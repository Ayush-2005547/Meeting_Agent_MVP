I'm Terry Rose with counsel staff. Miss Rose is staffing this item. The Solid Waste Advisory Committee is comprised of industry representatives and interested citizens, and it's an advisory committee that provides recommendations to the council and the county executive about policies and programs related to solid waste, handling and disposal. And today will be taken up for appointments. And I fear Miss Rosen may have taken the majority of your staff report. Speaker 2: Good afternoon, Mr. Chair. Members of the Committee for the Record, Tara Rose, council staff. And as the Chair noted, agenda items five through eight concern appointments to the King County Solid Waste Advisory Committee and the materials begin on page seven of your packet. I'll briefly provide some background and then introduced the end point. The appointees. State law requires each county to establish a solid waste advisory committee to assist in the development of programs and policies concerning solid waste handling and disposal. King County Solid Waste Advisory Committee was established in the mid 1980s and per county code, and as the Chair noted, the SWAC is comprised of at least nine and not more than 20 members representing a balance of interests, including citizens, local elected officials and industry representatives. Our code also requires that the committee shall include one representative from each of the two bargaining units representing the greatest number of solid waste division employees, as well as one representative who resides within a mile of the Cedar Hills Regional Landfill that's owned and operated by the county. Unless there are some additional questions on the role of the committee, I'll now introduce the candidates. And Mr. Chair, would you like them to come up one by one or at the conclusion of my remarks or. Speaker 0: Whatever you would like if all four of them would come up as a panel? Speaker 4: Okay. Speaker 2: Great. So proposed motion 2019 0339 would confirm the executive's appointment of Lee Eric Moman, who lives in District two as a citizen representative. Mr. Roman's application notes that he has spent the last 11 years of his career focused on managing waste disposal and processing in both the public and private sectors. He currently works for Seattle Public Utilities as a solid waste operations manager. Propose Motion 2019 zero three for one would confirm the executive's appointment of Heather Trim, who lives in District four as a representative from the recycling industry. Mrs. Trims application indicates that she is the executive director of Zero Waste Washington, which is an organization that works to reduce waste, improve recycling and remove toxic chemicals from products through policy, advocacy and community program. Motion 2019 0366 would confirm the executive's appointment of Robin Friedman, who lives in District one as a representative from the Solid Waste",

This award also celebrates our significant community partnerships with Long Beach Unified School District, the YMCA, Early Childhood Education and Safe Long Beach, just to name a few. I also thank the Long Beach Public Library Foundation for funding our Family Learning Centers, studios and other initiatives.

Please see your program booklet for more information. In addition to the National Medal, we can receive a $5,000 award, which is on tonight's Agenda for Your Consideration. I was deeply honored to accept this medal on behalf of the women and men of the Long Beach Public Library.

Speaker 5: Reshevsky. Speaker 2: Thank you, Mayor Pro Tem of some time ago we at this council did discuss about making data open and available and one of the requests was to as many other cities are doing, they're putting their checkbook online, which means that they put the expenditures online so that taxpayers can see how money is being spent. We we don't do that. There is a sense an open government platform was developed. It it does transparent operations for a number of cities. It's called managed transparency. They take the government chart of accounts and they show how the money flows through the city, not just how it's stored in databases, complete with educational content that helps simplify and explain government finance. The open government platform helps citizens see the complete picture, and to date, they have actually provided this service to 62 local governments, many of which are in California.

Council member say the Barker. Speaker 3: Thank you, Madam Chair. Just. I mean, Madam President, just wanted to call to attention. We've heard from many people over the last few weeks about the potential of gutting the Fair Elections Fund this year to fund our proposed council amendments. We've heard a lot of opposition to that idea. I stated it in our operating operations meeting last week, but I'll say it again for those tuning in for the first time, the way that this source fund for our amendments was unilaterally slipped into the letter by the mayor or letter to the mayor by Councilman Flynn was disrespectful to those of us who did our homework and proposed our own identified appropriate sources for each of the amendments that we proposed. The choice to defund fair elections instead of defunding the police or the militarized occupation of our communities by DPD and other private and partner local law enforcement entities was tone deaf to the hundreds of people who've devoted their time to us through emails, calls, testimony. As someone who's been chastised for direct filing and allegedly not engaging community. I find it ironic that we're voting on a direct file defunding the clerk in recorder's office without having that office's support to get this fund. In fact, I reached out to them about the proposed idea when it happened and they knew nothing about what was going on. And so I hope that my colleagues will recognize the self-serving nature of defunding the Fair Elections Fund, a fund that could potentially actually help pay for a challenger to take anyone and all of our seats . I hope that with that recognition, recognition that you will not give the public a reason to come for your seats. Colleagues, please vote no tonight and show the public that we respect them enough not to undermine fair elections and this fund in its very first year of implementation. Thank you, Madam President.

I'm here requesting that you adopt a resolution certifying the Environmental Impact Report and adopt a statement of overriding consideration for the Alamitos Avenue Complete Streets Improvement Project. This project will reduce the cross section of Alamitos from two lanes each direction to one, traveling in each direction with a two way left turn lane and protected bike lanes from Ocean Boulevard to Seventh Street. It will continue the Rhode Island saw last year from Seventh Street to Pacific Coast Highway. This proposed cross section will improve safety for all users in the corridor. The no recross section will calm auto traffic, reduce the crossing distance for pedestrians crossing Alamitos Avenue, and provide a safer bicycle facility for bicyclists traveling along Alamitos Avenue from 2012 through 2016, there are 29 collisions involving people on bicycles and people walking on this segment of Alamitos. There are also a total of 205 collisions. During that same time period, the project will add 23 parking stalls during the peak hours by removing the existing peak hour parking restrictions at a time of day when residents have a high demand for on street parking and will remove five all day parking stalls. The road died on Alamitos Avenue from seventh Street. North Pacific Coast Highway has worked well from a traffic safety and operations perspective and has resulted in fewer traffic collisions, with the collision rate dropping nearly 50% since its implementation, bicycle ridership has also increased after the roadway was installed. This project is consistent with the Bicycle Master Plan update unanimously approved by council in February as the Orange Artesia Corridor is a key North-South connector connecting Central and North Long Beach communities to downtown. And the beach is also consistent with the Vision Zero principles unanimously adopted by Council in May 2016 by improving multi-modal safety.

When this happens, people's property is taken, people are pushed along. We've witnessed them. We've participated in watching what happens to people, whether they're offered shelter or not. Often they are not offered shelter, not taken to shelter, only pushed along and possessions confiscated. And so while I recognize this is not an expansion of the $6 million, I do think it's important for my colleagues to recognize that under no circumstances should we be expanding the authority of who gets to draw down on these dollars. And in fact, in the midst of a housing crisis, we should be reallocating these dollars toward the solution rather than a reactive response to the symptoms of a problem.

The committee recommends the bill pass. Thank you. Casper Peterson, it's all you. Speaker 5: Thank you. Council president. Colleagues, this bill passed unanimously out of our Transportation Utilities Committee last month. This is the very last in a series of council actions to clean up access and ownership of parcels of land needed to facilitate the Georgetown of South Park Pedestrian and bike trail. This ambitious trail project, which will benefit both District one and two, is already funded by prior council budget actions. It's been gratifying to see Seattle City Lights, Public Utilities, Seattle Parks and Rec and the Seattle Department of Transportation work together collaboratively and seamlessly to shepherd this complex project through the council. The project includes vacating a dead end street nearby at City Lights Cell Service Center that will pave the way, literally and figuratively, for significant public benefits along the trails right of way, including a new future dog park. Again, the Transportation Utilities Committee voted unanimously for this council bill, and I'm hoping for a full support of the council today to move this project forward.

I want to thank you, Seattle City Light and Department of Transportation for their joint efforts. As you all know, we worked really hard a few years ago to pass a resolution to make sure that every parcel of public land was being used for the public good and that we prioritize housing. I understand that this property is a public benefit as identified in its origination, and the use of the street vacation requested by City Light clearly identifies that there's going to be a public benefit. But the property did not go through the process outlined in resolution 31829 or Resolution 31424, which is the surplus lands legislation that passed in 2018. Again, my hope is that all pieces of property will explicitly go through the process so that we can continue to show to members of the community how parcels, including those owned by City Light, will be reviewed for potential affordable housing development, even as the first priority remains affordable housing.

I want to extend my appreciation to cancer Louisiana for her willingness to lead on this issue with me. Despite her absence today through this year's budget process, we dug deeper into to get a better understanding not just of the figures and numbers from each individual department, but the Office of Budget Management's narrative analyzing trends in the city's fiscal condition over the span of several years. A couple of weeks ago, I filed orders related to city personnel and the state of the public sector workforce. After reviewing 20 years of staffing level data, revealing some striking trends, only looking at the current year and the past couple of years didn't show the historic trends. The same is the case for Boston's relationship with the state. We have to look at the long view to understand the big picture. Over the past 20 years, the city's net revenue in state aid has been reduced by over 300 million per year or a 70% reduction. Our state aid has been dropping, but but year over year, our state assessments for charter school tuition and the MTA climb exponentially. The result is in our budget, year after year is increased reliance on property taxes for a revenue source. 20 years ago, the property tax accounted for 55% of our revenue. Now, 20 years later, it's expected to reach 75% of our revenue. This relationship is unsustainable for the city and our residents. In 2006, Mayor Menino commissioned the BRT research department to conduct a report called Boston Gives More Than It Gets from the Rest of Massachusetts. It found that we generate more than our fair share of state instead jobs, state tax revenue, state income, corporate excise, and business tax revenue, visitor revenue, and state hotel tax revenue. But we do not get our fair share. It was a problem then, and it is a problem now. We have an opportunity to forge transformative partnerships with our colleagues at the state level. We have a mayor and city council whose policies at times require state approval that move at a glacial pace. We know our home rule petitions take forever. Like the CBA reforms reform bills submitted in 2019, which is still hasn't moved anywhere. If the state is going to pursue targeted scrutiny and oversight of the city of Boston, we should we should assess what is and isn't working from the current relationship for the interests of the city.

I am Karen with Landmark Preservation, with Community Planning and Development and we are here for a designation of 2600 Milwaukee Street known as the Henderson House. The landmark ordinance, established in 1967, provides the ability to designate properties. This particular property is brought forward by Councilman Elvis Brooks as the applicant. The owner of the property, Leon Henderson, is in support of this designation. His father, John Henderson, started the designation process earlier this year and unfortunately he passed away this summer as it was going through the writing process. The property is located on the corner of 26th Avenue and Milwaukee Street, across the street from the City Park Golf Course. As you know, in order for a property to become a Denver landmark, it needs to meet the designation criterion in at least two of the following three categories. It needs to maintain its historic and physical integrity, and the LPC should consider how it relates to a historic context or theme. This particular application puts forward that the property is significant under history for having a direct association with the historical development of the city, state or nation, and under two criteria for architecture embodying, embodying a distinguishing characteristic of an architectural style and being a significant work of a recognized architect. For the first under history for having a direct association with the historical development of the city of Denver, this house was designed by John Henderson. In 1959, he became the first African American architect who was licensed in Colorado. He worked as a draftsman and an architect for several prominent firms in Denver, as well as for the federal government. When he came out here in the 1950s, there had been a considerable growth of Denver in the postwar time period. But unfortunately, due to redlining, which had further entrenched segregation, there were limited options for the Henderson family. John Henderson spoke in detail with Shannon Stage, who is the author of this designation, about his difficulties in finding a location in a house to purchase because they couldn't find a place to purchase. He worked with Charlie Cousins, who was a prominent African-American businessman, to purchase this particular plot of land. As you can see noted on the screen, it was one of the final plots of land that had not been purchased and developed in 1960. So he owned this and then he designed this property and he designed",

The busses that currently use the Alaskan Way Viaduct to access downtown Seattle will access downtown from Alaskan Way and that on Alaskan way. Metro will not operate more than 650 busses per day until sound transit light rail to the Alaska junction goes into service. Speaker 1: And this would. Speaker 3: Also apply when Alaskan Way opens to busses in 2020 until 2023, when light rail is planned to reach West Seattle. One thing I want to just note it's really important to keep in mind that busses will no longer be able to use the Alaskan Way Viaduct when that's removed in 2019. Speaker 1: So for roughly a year, the busses. Speaker 3: That we're talking about as part of the settlement will actually need to have an alternative or an alternate route to access downtown. This is something that I know Scott and King County are working to address in one city, one center city process. But there isn't a formal proposal yet to deal with this level of complexity that will significantly impact bus riders in West Seattle. Speaker 0: Correct. Any further comments? Thanks for those comments, Councilman Herbold. Please call the roll on the passage of the bill.

The first parcel, which is outlined in blue, we call the reshaped parcel. The second parcel outlined in red is the market rate parcel. Currently, that almost 33 acre property has the homeless, that Alameda point homeless accommodation, which is, among other things, 200 units of housing for formerly homeless people. And the proposal for the West Midway Development is to consolidate the Alameda Point homeless accommodation onto the 9.7 acre reshaped parcel and then free up the balance of the almost 23 acres for a market rate developer who would come in and develop up to 291 residential units, mixed use other commercial uses, and provide the backbone infrastructure that is required for the ultimate redevelopment of the reshaped parcel.

Nonprofit development partner Mid-Penn that DDA was approved in July of 2018. So shortly after the DDA was approved, the city issued an RFQ to identify and select a developer for the balance of the West Midway property. We received seven proposals in September of 2018. In February of last year, the Council selected two finalist developers.

The proposed motion, as the chair indicated, and we call on Governor Inslee, federal legislators and the Trump administration to impose an immediate moratorium on rent and mortgage payments.

Since presenting the 2017 Workforce Report to City Council, H.R. and the Technology Innovation Department met to discuss potential vendors for the online dashboard and next steps for moving the project forward, noting the dashboard will not be ready for public release until 2028 and Civil Service worked diligently to release this report, which we are here to present to you today.

As such, human resource collaborates with civil service because our ability to have a diverse workforce is dependent on the availability of a diverse and qualified civil service candidate pool. Drilling down on race and ethnicity. The city's ethnic minority workforce is divided as follows Asian, 14%, black, 13%. Latina, 34%. And Native American 1%.

Just one more public hearing of the night. And as Andrew had promised earlier, this is a very targeted text amendment proposed for the Denver zoning code. Speaker 1: And before you kick off, do you want to introduce yourself? Speaker 0: Apologies. I'm a barge with the Department of Community Planning and Development, and I'm here with a text amendment to the Denver Zoning Code to correct an error that was introduced into the zoning code with the 2021 bundle of Denver Zoning Code text amendments. That bundle was adopted by City Council in the summer, and the error inadvertently reduced the maximum building footprint that was allowed for detached accessory dwelling units on zone lots greater than 6000 square feet in basically all of the single unit districts in the urban edge neighborhood context. That includes the zone district that was justified earlier this evening to a couple of areas of East Colfax. We'd like to get this corrected. The proposed amendment would have no impact on any other zoned district or building form. We're using a process allowed by the zoning code to begin the adoption process with Council Committee. So Planning Board has not considered or made a recommendation on this proposed text amendment. The next few slides just quickly walk you through what happened here. We're looking at a portion of the detached accessory dwelling unit building form table in Article four of the Denver Zoning Code. That's the urban edge neighborhood context, specifically at the maximum building footprint on a couple of lot sizes for single unit zone districts, the maximum building footprint being the portion of the lot area that an accessory dwelling unit building form can cover, like looking at a lot fewer dimensionally. It has historically been 864 square feet for detached views on lot 6000 to 7000 square feet and 2000 square feet on lots greater than 7000 square feet. This is the public review draft for the bundle of text amendments and you see various proposed changes marked up there which circle those two maximum buildings. Footprints are not marked up as a change, and yet those numbers are different. So just going back to that previous slide, we had 864 square feet and 1000 square feet.

The two, though, are we're bringing them together in this one staff report because they're both, we believe, instrumental to improving and modernizing our ability as a city to manage public parking here in Alameda. They're both of these actions, we believe, are consistent with your general plan policies that talk about the need to manage parking as a as a tool in managing our transportation network. And there is no bigger issue in Alameda, or at least there hasn't been historically than transportation in our ability to manage traffic and transportation and parking is a piece of that. And the general plan recognizes that the 2014 Alameda Point Transportation Demand Management Plan adopted by the City Council, the 2018 Transportation Choices Plan and your 2019 Climate Action Plan all talk about how important it is that we effectively manage parking, not just to make sure that everyone can get access to public parking when they need it at a price",

As the title suggests, the legislation executes and accepts a waterway permit and three sequential waterway permits for the Seattle Police Department's Harbor Patrol. Use of what is called Waterway 20. This is the area to the west of the city owned Speedy Harbor Patrol facility adjacent to Gasworks Park. The area contains a dock, a holding pen enclosed by a log boom and a concrete boat ramp. This is on land that is under the jurisdiction of the Washington State Department of Natural Resources. Harbor Patrol has been using it for some time for temporary storage of navigational hazards, impounded or stolen vehicles, evidence and other uses. And as it relates to navigational hazards. This is detritus that they collect in the water as a condition of the permit. Frsc will have to meet with the Wallingford Council and the Center for Wooden Boats on a monthly basis in order to create a future conceptual plan for the use of Waterway 20, which meets the interests of both the city and the Community Council. It was a really interesting article that appeared in Crosscut a few weeks ago about the history of the waterways. Notes that the Harbor Patrol has been using it since 1962 and this would approve a permit to do so. There's been strong community interest in public access to the water at this particular location, and I'm really pleased that the permit itself addresses this by including as a condition of the permit. The Air Force will meet with the Wallingford Community Council and the Center for Wooden Boats on a monthly basis in order to create this future conceptual plan.

So the timeline here, the application for 1500 East First Street actually started last year. But this is sort of a winding process to get through this. The other three applications add on 3200 days. First Street and Robles and Pine Avenue were actually filed in February of this year and went through the Mills Act process and that's how they came before Development Services.

This is in order to qualify for landmark status, at least one of the following criteria needs to be found in the affirmative. So we have four criteria out of these.

A code the committee recommends about pass as amended. Speaker 0: Catherine Gonzalez. Speaker 2: Thank you. Council President Harrell colleagues Rachel and Erin Elder and members of the public. It is with both a heavy heart and immense joy that I advance council bill 119513 as amended in committee, otherwise known as BS law for a vote by the full council today. If approved, this bill will correct a gap and oversight in our existing paid family care program applicable to municipal employees and their families like the Elders. It will do so by doing the following. First, it defines qualifying death to include the death of a child or the death of a domestic partner or spouse who died from childbirth or from complications related to childbirth. Second, if there is a qualifying death, then it will allow a parent or surviving domestic partner or spouse the ability to access paid family care leave benefit of up to four weeks without drawing down vacation or sick leave within 12 months of that qualifying event, the City Budget Office has estimated that this policy change does not have a significant fiscal impact and can be implemented without additional budget appropriation by the City Council. As I mentioned during council briefing, this is not a legislative fix to a hypothetical scenario. We have had multiple occasions to discuss the specific circumstances of Rachel and Aaron's loss of their daughter, Beatrice. A short 36, 36 hours after her arrival into this world, we have seen the pictures of be we've heard the heartwarming stories of the profound love that Bea gave her moms in that short window of life. We are now bearing witness to a legacy that will leave an indelible mark on our cities family friendly work policies. I am honored to play a very small role in advancing that legacy today. Rachel and Erin had many choices in the aftermath of the loss of BEA and learning that our family leave policies were inadequate for the needs of their family. They chose to effectuate change, to effectuate change by contacting their union protection and sharing their grief as an example and catalyst for change, for positive change, for themselves and for future families. As a result, today, we take a final vote on this legislation that more fully recognizes the realities of the sudden loss of a child. Our city employees should be able to focus on healing with their with their families in these moments. And Bea's law will provide qualifying employees with four paid weeks to do so.

So I'm going to take these in. Somewhat reverse order. So in 2003, City Council approved the Cherokee Gates Urban Redevelopment Plan, establishing the Cherokee Gates Urban Redevelopment Area. At that time, tax increment financing was not approved as the development program had not been identified. In 2006, Council approved an amendment to the Cherokee Gates plan to authorize tax increment financing to support the construction of certain public improvements required to advance the redevelopment of the site. For a variety of reasons, including the economic downturn in 2008. The Cherokee Denver plan did not move forward. Well, that plan did not advance. A portion of the area. South of Mississippi Avenue was redeveloped by Trammell Crow Residential. That development has generated approximately $3.19 million of incremental property taxes. None of that tax increment has been spent by Durham and upon repeal of the Cherokee Gates plan will be returned to the original taxing entities in the following approximate amounts. DPS Denver Public Schools will receive $1.97 million, the city and county of Denver approximately 1.2 million, and urban drainage and flood control district just over $24,000. So with the originally the existing plan repealed, we are now looking to establish the I-25 and Broadway urban redevelopment area. The proposed area is approximately 85 acres and is generally bounded by Broadway to the east south Santa Fe Drive to the west, Interstate 25 to the north and west Mississippi Avenue to the south.

Speaker 0: Councilmember Wirth. Speaker 3: Thank you. As you know, Mayor Nation is a fantastic local business that has been growing since 2009. Owners Camila and Ross dreamed up a delicious fusion of Hawaiian and Korean cuisine. Very nation, started with a mobile food truck and now they have four locations. In 2013, Muir Nation entered into a concession agreement with the Department of Parks and Recreation to lease the Seacrest boathouse at the Seacrest very dock. Very nation has put $200,000 of improvements into the boathouse. This led to this legislation is an update to their lease agreement to make their payments to the Department of Parks and Recreation consistent with other market rate partnerships. It would require imagination to pay $32 per square foot plus 2% of their gross receipts. This will increase consistency for imagination so they can continue to have successful a successful business and partnership with Parks and Recreation. Speaker 0: Thank you. Thank you. Casper. In words, any further comments or questions? Councilmember Herbold. Speaker 5: Well, first of all, it's no surprise that the rate that they were paying greatly outstripped their expectations. It's an incredibly popular and delicious restaurant. I do have a question about the looking at the fiscal note. It looks like the changes that we are voting on today will go back to 2013. The fee payment a change change will be effective. 22nd October 2013. And I don't need to know this now if you don't know the information off the top of your head when you're looking at the fiscal note, it shows an impact of $90,000 in 2016 and 2017. And I believe that's the revenue that they are anticipating to receive moving forward under this new rate. My question is, is are we giving are we giving them a refund for for fees paid over and above what they're required? And and if so, I'd be interested to know a little bit more about that. Speaker 3: I believe we are not giving them a refund. If I remember correctly. Speaker 0: I would sort of chime in and say that I was at the committee discussion when the.

My name is Andrew Johnston with the Department of Finance. I'm here to give you the staff report on the new metropolitan district. It's a Council Bill 686 Series 2018 four, an ordinance approving a service plan for a new metropolitan district titled Football Stadium Metropolitan District. The service plan is being submitted to City Council for approval on behalf of the Metropolitan Football Stadium District. Pursuant to the requirements of the Special District Act, sections 32, dash one, desk 201 and more particularly 32. Dash one, dash two or 4.5. The land on which the football stadium and its parking lots are built is owned by the Metropolitan Football Stadium District, which is created pursuant to the state statutes. This is the Seven County District created to initially fund the existing stadium with a sales tax. The sales tax supporting the stadium expired in December 31, 2011, when its related debt was paid off. The stadium is 18 years old and leased by the Denver Broncos and Stadium Management Company, LLC. The purpose of the new development on the Southern parking lots that will continue to be owned by the football stadium district is to create a sustainable revenue stream over time to contribute towards capital improvements and repairs at the stadium without having to go to the taxpayers for additional funding. The sustainable revenue stream will come from the long term ground leases that developers pay to build on the land. The new Metropolitan District will facilitate the needed public improvements and financing required to prepare the southern parking lots for vertical developers. The new Metropolitan District will be responsible for coordinating the financing, acquisition, construction, completion operation and maintenance of all public infrastructure and services within and without the service area, including without limitation, all streets. Safety. Protection. Water. Sewer, storm. Drainage. Transportation and park and recreation facilities. The new metropolitan district will have the power to raise revenues pursuant to the authorities granted by the Special District Act, including the imposition of up to 50 mills plus rates, fees, tolls and charges. The new metropolitan district will also be authorized to impose up to five mills for regional improvements at the discretion of the city. The total estimated costs for the public improvements necessary to serve the contemplated development are approximately 146 million. In order for the new metropolitan district to have the fiscal wherewithal to provide the funding for the upfront costs of the public improvements needed",

So can you tell me a little bit about what that will cover and entail? Exactly. Speaker 5: Craig. Speaker 2: Certainly Councilmember Gonzales, members of the council, the item that you have before you is really focused on the operating side of our parking lots, not so much the CHP elements, which we we do have a number of those coming forward. But we felt it was prudent to make a reinvestment in many of our facilities, especially the city place garage in the downtown. And we've added a number of security personnel and security hours over the course of 24 seven operation in City Place alone, we've added over 160 hours of security time.

We've increased the frequency of power washing in those garages where we have a number of other items that we're going to be addressing moving forward.

I'm here today to discuss with you the process and timeline for selecting a new city manager. And staff is seeking some direction on how to move forward at this point. I believe you've seen the report that talks about the general timeline that we're looking at. And I think the some of the major questions that we need to. Some guidance on at this point is the where we go forward in terms of the recruitment. We have two avenues which to choose. One is to do an internal recruitment. The second is to go outside with a recruitment firm. In my experience, when you're hiring someone at the level of a city manager, it is typical to use an outside recruitment firm. They are the folks who are out there with their fingers on the pulse of who's who's available in the city manager, land and city staff. Really, we don't have that information. They will also put out the full color brochures. They know what the trends are and this is what staff is actually recommending at this point. I'm here for any questions on the report or the timeline. Speaker 5: Member Daisuke. The question I have and I sent it earlier to the city manager because I seen it recently, one city they've put out to bid the the service to define city managers. For example, in your staff report, you've identified a whole number of potential human resources agencies. I think in the past, I think we just kind of selected one I can't remember generally. Speaker 3: Well, we've done both internally and we have selected firms based on you know, I called around to find out basically what they're charging and who's available. And one thing I have found is that some firms are very busy right now. And so it's going to be depending on who's available and who people, you know, say that they, you know, are available to do a city manager recruitment, the city of Alameda, because that's a big recruitment. Speaker 5: So let me just the question I have is and I'm not locked into any position, it's just a question that I want to make sure to put out there. You know, what thoughts have you given to putting out to bid? Yeah. Who who we select. Speaker 3: Well, in terms of bidding process, and it's a good question, this isn't the kind of thing that normally goes out to bid. Number one, the cost level is quite low. We don't usually put out things to bid until unless they're at a higher price point. And this is also a type of professional service where the cost is, is",

We have this motion and then a motion at the planning commission that will happen on Thursday, and that'll really complete the major agreement for the private development on the Mid-Block site. So what is envisioned is when this project was originally envisioned, they had looked at a hotel and about 300 units of housing. That was about four years ago, and market conditions had changed. And so we actually have 1200 units of hotels that are either have been built or are in the process of being entitled, are being built. And so naturally, this has been changing. The the new entitlement is actually sort of the newer plan is to actually maximize housing at 580 units as opposed to the roughly 300 they were looking at before, 10% affordable and actually bringing on a grocer in downtown as well, which we're really excited about and then creating some synergy around features and some community benefit so that teachers would be able to to have about 100 of those units and really create kind of a synergy downtown. So additionally in the South report, we have the ability to move forward with the final agreement on city hall and then also using some of the dollars that we're mostly getting from impact fees, but also the harbor department and some county imagery to enhance Lincoln Park and make it really a special park.

Speaker 9: It seems the public comment scene on Councilmember Pearce. Speaker 7: Yes. I'd like to turn it over to staff for staff presentation. Then behind the veil for conversation. Speaker 1: Good evening, honorable mayor and council members. As you remember, in October of 2016, the City Council requested a report on the feasibility of implementing a safe parking program. The Health Department did so looking at five other cities. Almost all were in California. One was in Washington. They identified five best practices, basically, that everyone who participates in the Safe Parking program is working on transitioning into permanent housing. They're generally run by nonprofit agencies, usually utilizing a variety of resources. They have a well-developed relationship with local police departments. But what we found is that they haven't had to use that very much, that they operate only in evening hours. So they tend to maybe start at five or six at night and end at seven in the morning and that they do not allow for RV parking. Generally, the programs require that people engage in planning and services to reach permanent housing. The staffing is sort of a case manager and worker model and all the information is entered into the homeless management information system. So they're fully engaged. Those eligible to participate get a time limit. A parking permit might be 30 days, 60 days, 90 days. That is contingent upon their participation in services and that programs are mostly have a small number of units and multiple sites. So in many cases you only have five units, seven units, something like that. Um, so the, the recommendation was to do a pilot program with a number of sites up to approximately 20. And from that, the estimated cost is about $220,000, which include staffing, facilities, security and other materials. With that, I closed my presentation. Spaces. 20 spaces. Speaker 4: Just to clarify, that would not be two sites. Speaker 1: That would be two spaces. We're talking about that in. Speaker 4: One, two or three or other site. Speaker 7: Right. I think the. Appreciate the staff presentation. Again, a little bit of context.

I had full funding of the Long Beach Justice Fund written in here, but apparently you've taken care of that. I appreciate it. Last night, I got a chance to finally see RBG, the documentary about the life of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. I lived through that time period when she made most of her impact on law, and I watched her tireless efforts to educate the court about the reality of gender bias and discrimination. It's fair to say that she had quite an uphill fight. She had to face a court in which one of the members said, But, Mrs. Ginsburg, isn't it enough that we've put Susan B Anthony on the dollar? So most people at that time read that most men just didn't have a clue how egregiously women were discriminated against. Similarly, I lived through a very fierce battle for equality for my LGBT family and friends. Again, most of the leadership in government simply did not have any idea of the effect of exclusion, prejudice and bigotry on vast numbers of their neighbors and coworkers. Earlier, members of the community spoke eloquently about the impact of racism. Today, I'm painfully aware that too many residents of Long Beach live in complete ignorance of the incredible suffering of our immigrant neighbors from stereotyping, intolerance and now direct attacks from the federal government.

And thank you to Councilor Flynn for joining me in this. I'm going to speak on both of our behalf. Councilor Flynn and I have the benefit of sharing together the representation of Beacon Hill, and we'll have more working sessions under your remit, Mr. Chair, and opportunity to talk in greater detail. I'll be brief. Basically, when the Beacon Hill historic district extended down the North Slope in 1963, the city was poised to build our fire station on Cambridge Street, and people didn't want it to interfere. And so a very narrow strip of the last sort of 40 feet before Cambridge Street was excluded from the district in order to not have that complication. Now, there is the big project going on up on the other side of Cambridge Street and concern about some of the historic buildings, including the pepper building that's mentioned here from the 1890s that run on the Beacon Hill brick side of Cambridge Street. So the main thrust of this docket, and it's come to us from the Beacon, also the association and residents in the neighborhood is just to complete that last 40 feet of the district, which is something that I think most people assume is already in place, but actually technically isn't. So it's that and then a couple of other technical fixes to that. This is a home rule petition because the Beacon Hill historic district is in state statute. And so the first step would be amending it here at the council and then it would have to go up to the state. So just to say that this is something that has been discussed for a while and the Beacon Hill community and so folks have asked us to bring it forward. And I'm really pleased to be joining the council president and bring it forward today. So thank. Speaker 5: You. Thank you. Councilor Bracken. Anyone else like to speak on this matter? What anyone else like to add their name would add their name. I would. Okay. Chair Now recognized Councilor Fernandes Anderson. Speaker 4: I think you know what else can I say?

Seelbach is a district in a Globeville neighborhood, so the site itself is just over 6000 square feet. It's a single unit, residential. It's across the street from Argo Park and they're requesting an accessory dwelling unit. The current zoning is ESU. D it's surrounded by you. You do have some, um, x three, which is a mixed use, up to three stories in close proximity as well as s, which is open space. And then when we look at the land use, it's a single unit residential with single unit residential, some industrial and open space across across the street. And the site itself is in the upper left corner. As you can see, it's a one story structure and the park across the street. And it went before the planning board in May and it was approved unanimously. And as a present we have received no comments for this item. And when we're looking at specifically a rezoning, we have specific review criteria that we analyze based off the Denver zoning code. And the first one is consistency with adopted plan. So we're looking at comprehensive plan 2040 Blueprint, Denver, L.A. and Transportation Plan of 2019 and the Global Neighborhood Plan of 2016. There are several strategies found in the staff report that this case is consistent with. And so I would jump into Blueprint Denver. And so Blueprint Denver classifies this area as urban, which where you see the small area plan as well as a blueprint deviate from what it's currently zone, which is the urban edge. And so urban edge is more a transition between urban and suburban. But this area is one of the few areas in the city where Blueprint Denver, as well as the neighborhood plan, specifically call out for a change in the neighborhood context. And so this neighborhood context is urban, which is a small multi-unit, residential and low intensity mixed uses buildings typically embedded in single unit and two unit residential areas , and it offers good walkability with short predictable blocks as well as when we look at the place type, the place type is single and two unit uses and accessory dwelling units. ADAS are appropriate as well as Pennsylvania Street is a local street which are primarily served by residential uses. As well as Blueprint has policy around AIDS, which is policy for which talks about the expansion of accessibility throughout all residential areas. And then when we when we dove into the neighborhood plan, the global",

Relating to contracting by the Human Services Department, the committee recommends the bill passed as amended. Speaker 0: Very good. Who would like to speak on this item? Customer Herbold. Speaker 9: Thank you. This ordinance was crafted with input from community providers, the Human Services Department, community based researchers. My fellow city council members. It is a new version of a bill that was referred to us by Mayor Burgess. Results based accountability is utilized at 77% of HST contracts. The ordinance is intended to direct HST and how to utilize our results based accountability in designing their future investments while maintaining some some oversight by the Council before that is done. It's crafted specifically to address potential unintended consequences related to results. Based contracting specifically includes the definition of culturally responsive research. And we did that because culturally responsive research is cognizant of and understands and addresses the cultural context in which the research takes place. This includes the inclusion of community based organizations and other stakeholder perspectives in designing the study, as well as designing the programs themselves. Developing the measures that those programs will be held to to meet. Interpreting the data and disseminating the findings. There's been a lot of discussion around pay for performance. This ordinance does not mandate performance pay, but allows it at the directors discretion. Speaker 0: Very good. Thank you. Councilman Herbold, any further comments on this particular bill, Councilmember Sean. Speaker 2: Thank you. President Harrell I made these comments at the Budget Committee meeting this morning, but I knew I should make them again because this is again being voted in for council. First, I want to say that I appreciate this version from Councilmember Herbold and the effort that was put into making the or trying to make the results based accountability contracting ordinance less harmful than the version that Mayor Burgess sent to council last month. However, the idea is fundamentally not beneficial to human service providers, and I intend to vote no. It will create additional red tape that human service providers will need to wade through to receive funding. The larger, well-resourced nonprofits will be able to hire the necessary accountants to make to get through. But community based nonprofits will find it difficult to meet the requirement no matter how excellent their work. It is to me akin to the standardized testing approach that has been shoved down the throats of our public schools by politicians who want to look like they're serious about. Improving education without doing the one thing that education needs, which is provide more funding for education so that class sizes are reduced. This is in the same vein, unfortunately, because our human service providers need more funds, not more red tape. When we talk about results, I think we have to you know, this is missing this.",

I mean, I don't I don't see anything that our, you know, police department is not doing to either solve crimes that happen or prevent crimes from happening. But I did want to point out that I think there was some discussion offline about Prop 47 in a study that came out by the PC. And, you know, the. The headline. You know, one is that violent crime has not increased in California due to Proposition 14 or Proposition 47. And the other headline, even though some people are touting this on the right, that some of these property crimes have increased, it's important to note that, you know , they've increased. They went from the lowest on record and the increase was to the second lowest on record. So even though there may have been a slight increase, which you may or may not attribute to Prop 47, we are still in a really good period when it comes to property crimes, especially when you compare it to the rates back from the seventies and eighties. So I just want people to, you know, not get caught up in the in the data because Mike McMahon used to tell me there's lies, damned lies and statistics.

The committee recommends the bill pass. Speaker 0: Thank you, Madam Clerk. Councilmember Mosqueda, as chair of the committee, you are recognized in order to provide the committee report. Thank you very much, Madam President. Colleagues, I'm really excited about this piece of legislation in front of us. This is a piece of legislation that the community has been advocating for for many years, as we heard in the committee presentation. Almost a decade of work has gone into securing the site that Byrd Bar has offered. This is a site that has nurtured and invested in community. And now the individuals who work at Verve are the community that is supporting Byrd Bar are awaiting ownership to implement improvements and plan for the future. We had a discussion in the Finance and Housing Committee last week and heard from the Mayor's Office of Obesity, Department of Neighborhoods and Byrd bar themselves directly about the process to get here. Byrd Bar, by way of background, has served Seattle residents for over 50 years, providing basic human services like housing assistance, energy assistance, food bank and personal financial resources with special attention given to individuals from diverse backgrounds such as making sure that our elders are immigrants and refugees and people with disabilities have their needs met. That power is not shut off. That as eviction assistance is provided to those who are struggling to make ends meet. This building is an anchor in the community. The building also houses a community food bank. And in hearing from Andrea Kaplan, the Byrd Bar spokesperson, about what this transfer means, it means that the organization will be able to have its roots firmly in community and be able to invest in building on the property in the ways that have been long awaited by the community. And that is also important to have ownership in this transfer. This is one of several mutual and offsetting benefit sites or MLP sites that the city currently owns. But for all intents and purposes, the community organization that is leasing the site from the city has been the longtime store and has taken ownership and responsibility for the site in always but the deed and title. So in late 2018, the Council passed a resolution committing to collaborate with the Executive to ensure the transfer of the property and ensure that there was a recognition of the residents who've been there and to move the site over to their ownership in March of 2019. It has been a long process in getting here to this point today. I'm excited to move this forward. We",

This process will proceed like our recent district court appointments. Members were sent and should have received the application materials by email on Monday.

So the chart behind you and for the audience shows that we're here today to discuss the consolidated plan in the annual action plan. But we feed into that information from our housing element and from our recently adopted assessment for for Fair Housing, which was also a federal housing and urban development requirement. CDBG funding has declined significantly since our high of almost $14 million in funding back in 2003. We get roughly 5.3 to $5.6 million a year right now, and that's what we will be getting for our fiscal year 18. We as this chart shows that we will be getting 5.5 million in CDBG, $491,000 for ESG, which is, again, the emergency services grant, and about $2.1 million for home for a total entitlement of 8.177. We are an entitlement city, which means that it is not a competitive process for us. And so we do have the ability to receive this money directly from HUD. Here is your CDBG eligible areas.

Speaker 4: Thank you. Council president colleagues, this is the bill to create the fifth avenue via. We discussed this in the Community Economic Development Committee on September eight. We heard from proponents of the idea and also held a public hearing on it. So as you know, the way this works, local businesses vote to assess themselves, to provide cleanup services, graffiti removal, to be able to host neighborhood events and marketing, provide marketing services to the local businesses. I will say we did have some concern. We heard from some commercial tenants about their concern. As you know, it is the property owners who get to vote on whether or not to assess themselves. The small businesses who may rent from these owners don't get to participate in that vote. So we hear from some of them that they were concerned about the impact on them, assuming that this may pass down in the form of higher rents. So I did amend the legislation in committee to ensure that at least two commercial tenants are on the board and that we include the option of using some of the assessment revenue to pay for small business assistance or other programs that can help keep small businesses from getting displaced. I do want to thank Councilmember Peterson and his staff who had proposed similar legislation when you district the air was passed several months ago. So thanks for working with us to do something similar here. And as Amelia said, we did pass this unanimously out of committee on September 21st. So I am encouraging my colleagues to support the bill.

By way of very brief background, the King County Department of Community and Human Services manages a wide range of programs and services to assist the county's most vulnerable residents and strengthen its communities. The Department is also responsible for providing leadership and coordination to the regional efforts to address homelessness through all home, as well as oversight and management of the revenues from the Veterans, Seniors and Human Services.

His work experience, which is described in further detail in his resumé, includes serving as the DCH, US Veterans and Human Services Levee Renewal Manager and then as director of the DC Jazz Community Services Division.

Financial Management Recommendation to award a contract to Environmental Construction Group for the City of Long Beach. Old Courthouse Abatement and demolition for a total contract amount not to exceed 4.4 million District two. Speaker 0: Thank you. There there is a motion in a second before I get there. I know staff. Do you have a short presentation? Speaker 11: Yes, you do. Speaker 9: Presentation by Mike Conway, our director of Economic and Property Development. Speaker 16: Mayor Garcia, Members of the City Council. This item requests authority to enter a contract with Environmental Construction Group Inc, the perceived low bidder for environmental abatement of the old courthouse. This is a rebid of an earlier bid in October, which was rebid in a manner that allows the city to contract only for abatement rather than for abatement and demolition. This approach allows abatement to start immediately, which needs to be done in the interest of public safety. Regardless of the ultimate fate of the courthouse building. Demolition of the courthouse building will require a separate action by city council at a future date. In response to this invitation to bid, seven bids are received, ranging from 5.9 million to 8.5 million, with six of the bids within $700,000 of each other. The initial low bidder, U.S. demolition was rejected as a result of an error on their bid bond. The city has long held posture regarding the reliability of bid bonds, which require that the bond is clearly valid. On its face, U.S. demolitions bid bond referred to the prior invitation to bid, not the current one. While this may seem like a ministerial error, it does call into question the validity of the bid bond. And the city's long standing position is that this error cannot be waived. Waiving this error in this case would call into question all prior rejections based on similar criteria and may expose the city to additional protests and adverse unintended consequences. Two more protests were received which were reviewed determined to have no merit and were rejected. This is an important to understand that bids of this monetary magnitude, with pricing so closely compressed, are almost almost guaranteed to generate protests. But time is of the essence for this abatement work to begin and staff request that council approved staff's recommendation. And I'm available for your questions. Speaker 0: Thank you.

The city acquired the areas in blue on this slide for open space purposes in 2001 and 2002. Through cooperative efforts with the Trust for Public Lands utilizing park bond money. The city received a grant from Rivers and Mountains Conservancy in July of 2001 for $5 million to acquire the remainder parcel, which is the 20 acre piece under discussion this evening. However, an agreement with oil operators could not be reached and the funding was returned. The 20 acre parcel has been used to separate brine from petroleum. The brine was then treated and disposed and the petroleum was sold. Operations ceased in approximately 19 1998, and development efforts have continued since that time for uses, including self-storage, the residential cemetery and open space. The property is primarily zoned to see us for commercial storage uses and a portion of the property is owned r-1 one for single family residential uses.

Speaker 0: It has been moved and seconded questions by members of Council Council Member State Abarca. Speaker 6: Thank you, Mr. President. I called this bill out specifically to go on record as voting no for this and just for the public who are who's viewing this. This is an ordinance that would be a blanket authorization of our annual work program, and that includes street paving, concrete traffic signals, pavement markings all within this work program and totals to probably over 25 million. Last year it was about 12 contracts. And for the same reasons that we are being asked to approve this, I will be a no. I don't believe that with contracts that are an annual expectation that there should be this need to expedite and have this blanket approval. I think that we have checks and balances of separate branches of government in place for a reason. And so to allow these 12 contracts and this $25 million to be spent without coming directly to council for each individual contract, I think is problematic. And just to remind people, this is not a practice that we've always had. It's only been a practice since 2011. And so I will be a no tonight and I hope my colleagues will join me. Thank you. Speaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember Councilmember Sawyer. Speaker 3: Thank you, Mr. President. I agree with Councilwoman CdeBaca. I have a lot of concerns about transparency and accountability. And I think that there you know, this is this last year was only regarding 12 contracts. I think that that's not too much to ask, that these 12 contracts come through one at a time to be approved by council . And so I will also be a know tonight. I think that, you know, these can come through just like all the other contracts that come through and are approved by council. So I will also be a no tonight. Thank you.

Speaker 5: Good evening, Michelle, of Community Planning in Development. Also here with me as Tina Axelrod and Michael Flaherty. So we're presenting a package with lots of changes to the Denver zoning code for clarifications and also substantive changes. We began in November by releasing a public review draft. So before we began the formal adoption process, we spent a lot of time with the community to walk through all the changes. We presented info items to planning board to the City Committee, which were then posted on Channel eight for folks to watch. And we hosted office hours, attended I and C really just to have that input before we began any formal process. In January, we, we did begin the formal adoption process. We went to the planning board and had a public hearing and that was approved unanimously, recommended approval unanimously. Based on that initial public review process, we actually took a number of things out. One, we needed more time to work with the community on the changes. We also found some new changes that we added based on public feedback, and those are all reflected in the package that you received. And we do have some comments of support as well for the package. So we've organized the text amendment into these groupings and we'll walk through just a summary, some highlights of the text amendment. Not not each change. You have each change in your packet, I believe, and I'll start with group one, which are design standards, and these are located in Articles three through nine of the Denver Zoning Code, and they include building forms and supplemental design standards, alternatives and exceptions. So a few examples here of changes we're making that are minor. We allow window wells to encroach into required setbacks three feet. If you have a setback. So a lot of times this is your single family home. The code also regulates the dimension that's running parallel to the home and limits it to four feet today. And we're proposing to increase that to six feet. And that's based on feedback from developers who have a new window product that they want to install. So this is a great, great change for that. We're also adding a number of graphics to our commercial mixed use sound districts. So you'll see here on the left page, this is the shop front building, farm and shop front. In the code today, there's one building that you can look at and it's a box. And it's sort of confusing that you actually can build a lot of different things under shopfront. So we added these graphics you'll see at the top a townhouse product. Single family, yes. You can construct single family in the main street zone districts using the shopfront building farm",

The Main Street districts are intended to allow a mix of uses that promote safe, active and pedestrian scaled commercial areas. The subject site is currently a three story district.

We almost called it the Up Beat Committee, urban planning, built environment and trees. I settled on plans instead. The first item is a moratorium on certain uses within the Araw Linton Springs Urban Village. Last October, we passed emergency legislation prohibiting certain uses that conflicts with our comprehensive plan goals for love. The moratorium was in response to continued application for uses such as storage and many warehouse facilities in a residential urban village. When those uses crop up, it tends to lock up our land use for two plus decades. And that's a place where we want to see more housing, not necessarily more self-storage units. So we asked for that emergency legislation, adopted it, and anticipated that those changes would be made permanent through the adoption of the citywide mandatory housing affordability proposal. But given the lengthy ness of that appeal, we are here asking for an extension of that moratorium by six months, as was outlined in public comment today. We've had a couple three folks in our position, maybe four or five, and received in excess of 100 emails and phone calls to the office in support of this extension .

I think the the feedback that you and others have talked about, about the number of comments are important. I also think, though, there are certain types of uses that we need to function as a city. Those uses have to be somewhere I've heard from because as soon as like the folks at Handy Andy that have talked about , if we, you know, they will be there because they're invested. But if these uses don't exist in our city, where will they go? And I think it's worth a conversation to make sure that we are creating spaces for the types of uses we need and also honoring, you know, neighborhood desire to evolve over time.

The portion of this funding that would be dedicated to projects in Seattle will go up from 6.8 million to 7.9 million with this additional size of the fund. The legislation before us today also makes some technical changes that were made by when the when the, you know, local agreement came through King County Council.

Just to orient folks, the parcel we're talking about is immediately north of the west Seattle Bridge along Harbor Avenue. It's between Harbor Avenue and Terminal five Port of Seattle property. And this would vacate Southwest City View Street and 29th Avenue Southwest. These are leftover remnants of a network of streets that used to exist on Terminal five, currently used for parking and common rail lines for Nucor Steel. The vacation proposal would allow the development of a self-storage warehouse in exchange of public benefit would include improvements to the the right away, the sidewalk in the trail, relocating some light poles the currently obstruction and it came up during committee that are actually after committee. It was highlighted by a trail advocate from West Seattle. Concerns about the proximity of the building to the trail and its sightlines can make it difficult for vehicles entering and exiting the what that doing a little research we realized there was a mistake in the presentation. Those concerns had largely been addressed already and the building had intended to set back from the trail to allow better sightlines for safety.

Cathartic protection keeps a metal pipe that's in the ground from degrading as quickly as it would without it. So these are very small holes that are being drilled so they can put a probe into the ground. The holes are about three quarters of an inch. So somewhere in the in the neighborhood of a size of a of a quarter. This type of work isn't going to do anything to degrade the streets.

In doing so, you found that the Urban Redevelopment Plan was in conformance with the Denver Comprehensive Plan 20 and its applicable supplements. While the Urban Redevelopment Plan authorizes the use of tax increment financing, TIF cannot be used until it is specifically approved for a project. Therefore, Debra is here this evening requesting City Council's consideration of an amendment to the Walton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan to add the 2801 Walton Street Project and create the 2801 Welton Street Property Tax Increment Area and sales tax increment area. The Urban Redevelopment area was established to encourage redevelopment along the Welland corridor. The Urban Redevelopment area is comprised of approximately 29 blocks, generally and approximately bounded by Broadway Street on the West Glenarm Place and 24th Avenue on the South Downing Street on the east and on the north by either California street or the alley between Welton and California streets. At the time the plan was originally approved, no projects were identified. However, the plan allowed for future projects to request tax, income and assistance and contemplated tax increment areas would be approved as projects were brought forward within the area to date. Following the outcome of the last public hearing, two projects have now been approved. The Affordable Housing Development at 2300 Welton and the mixed use predominantly residential project at 2460 Welton. The project, being considered through an amendment to the Urban Redevelopment Plan in this public hearing is the redevelopment of the site located at 2460 Welton Street. The project site, which includes a 5000 square foot vacant structure, is located at the northwest corner of 28th Street and Welton Street. The building was built in 1895 and has had a variety of uses over the years, including a tavern, a hotel and an apartment complex.

You know, on September the 17th, the Parks and Recreation Commission voted to increase the fees of the senior water aerobics classes at King and Silverado. A new fee was established at $2 a class or 4 to $450 a year per year individual. The average income in the city of Long Beach is $26,000 annually, which is below the national poverty level. Creating this new fee places an unnecessary burden on our aging population, as well as creating a burden to the physical activities to our older adults. I am simply asking our Parks and Recreation Commission to revoke the fee for seniors and look into taking other steps to increase their mainstream attendance to offset the pool cars by promoting pool use with families or additional programs to increase the revenue.

This is a report from the Office of Councilmember Gary DeLong and Councilman Residual, although with a recommendation to request the auditor to perform an independent review of the Marina Fund. Speaker 3: Mr. DOANE. Speaker 9: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I'm bring this item forward because boat owners for quite some time had been concerned about inappropriate charges, the marina fund. It become particularly concerning with the potential shortage of funding to commit to complete the rebuild and staff in 2013. Took a look at this and there was a memo in January of 2013 where they felt that perhaps there's $895,000 in charges that might not have been applied appropriately. But then subsequently, they came back after some additional analysis and either the numbers 195 or it could be 488, depending on how you read the memos. There's also some concerned I know Councilmember O'Donnell and others brought up recently. We had talked about the Army Osprey. Marina, was what was the historical should there have there been in the past an ongoing issue where expenses were charged, the Marina Fund, and that probably should have been a Tidelands or another fund. And then finally, I guess it's not clear from this what was correct in 2013, what was corrected this year, what needs to be corrected to make sure that it's certainly proper in for 15 and any trips that might be necessary would occur. So the purpose of this is to ask the city auditor to not recreate the will, but to take a look at the work product and get an understanding of how these determinations were made and then, you know, produce a report back to the council of what it ought to be. So my motion is to approve the recommendation. Speaker 0: That. Speaker 3: No one seconded. Any public comment on this issue? Please come forward. Identify yourself. You see the yellow light?

I live at 4300 Theresa Street in Long Beach, and I am the president of the Long Beach Marina Boat Owners Association. We support this audit for a number of reasons. I think Councilman DeLong highlighted most of them. We want to make sure that marina funds that are supported through our slip fees are used for marina purposes and not other purposes in the city. We do not like the idea of possibly being a cash cow for uses other than the marina. Our concern in the near term and longer term is that the Alamitos Bay rebuild continues on schedule. It's already fallen behind. You know that additional costs have been incurred because of that. And we know that it's the slip fees that pay for that rebuild. We want to make sure that we pay enough, but not too much. We want a first class, world class",

The business, the community and our public works department have worked very closely to address the concerns in this for this particular location, because it's located within close proximity to a lot of homes.

There is a brief staff report on this. Speaker 6: Craig Beck. Speaker 8: Good evening, Vice Member, Members of the City Council. Just real quickly. We're excited to bring this item before you this evening. The city staff has been working diligently with the telecommunications industry to bring forward small cell. And as you know, many people are using smartphones these days, mobile web browsing, video streaming, and that has led to the need for more data. The telecommunication companies are trying to address this by filling gaps in their cell sites with micro cell. And what that really means is they're they're asking the city to use our assets, primarily our street light poles, to place antennas and equipment that will allow them to have these facilities in place. We have worked we have a number of applications pending. The first application is before you this evening with a license agreement with Crown Castle. Crown Castle will install the equipment and essentially lease it to an operator like an AT&T or Verizon. One thing we would like to do to clarify the recommended action before you this evening is that this particular item is for 21 city owned sites. I want to make sure that we have that clarification in place, because it is likely that will we will we will be bringing additional Crown Castle applications to you in the future . And so this particular license agreement is for those 21 sites. The sites are primarily located. If you look at Exhibit A, they are down in our city's waterfront. So Shoreline, seaside, etc., primarily, they're down in the waterfront. I would add that your staff is working closely, both planning and building and public works, to bring forward a master license agreement that would help streamline the entire licensing process for the telecommunications company companies plural. We do have multiple companies that have filed applications that staff is working with. We anticipate that that master license agreement will come before council, hopefully before the end of this calendar year. That concludes the staff report. Speaker 3: Thank you, Mr. Beck.

Mayor Garcia, members of the City Council. This appeal from a determination of the Board of Harbor Commissioners is somewhat unique in the experience of the City Council. So I'm going to spend a little bit of time talking about the background of the actual approvals that the Board of Harbor Commissioners made. The scope of the appeal as it is before the City Council, the legal standard that the City Council would apply in making its determination on this appeal. The two options that are basically available to the Council when they're considering this matter and finally, the process that is allocating the time for both the Board of harbor commissioners and the appellants in this case to make their case. So as far as background, on June 9th of this year, the Board of Harbor Commissioners adopted two separate ordinances. And it's typical, unlike the way the city does it for the Board of Harbor Commissioners, to actually adopt an ordinance when they approve certain types of agreements. So in this case, the adopted ordinance number HD 2188 for the Metropolitan Stevedore Company, otherwise known as Metro Operating Agreement for the Pier G Dry Bulk Facility in the port. They also.

The scope of this appeal is really quite narrow, and it only involves whether or not the secret approvals were appropriately made by the port . The city's charter gives the port the absolute authority to make a determination . It's only the issue of whether the sequel determination was appropriate .  Port of Long Beach is responding to an appeal that has been filed not against our lease agreements, but against related environmental determinations . On June 9th, the Board of Harbor Commissioners approved two real estate agreements for the use and operation of existing port facilities on Pier G .

This is an ordinance that's the supplemental appropriation for 2014. The Finance Department, City Finance Department has chosen to lump together supplemental appropriations for several different purposes. The largest one for more than $1.3 million out of the general fund contingency is my main concern. The administration wants this money to be used for incentives for a specific business. Interestingly, they cite confidentiality so that we can't be told at this point what the business is. Well, I don't like making special deals for special businesses. Regardless, I'm not at all willing to do a, trust me, transfer to a business incentive fund I detest for a business that can't be named, so due diligence can't be performed. Keep in mind, even after we do learn the name, if we didn't like the company, the money will still be in this corporate welfare fund. We have many city basic services I'd prefer to use the money for or give overall tax relief to all businesses. So there's a level playing field. Well, I'm not objecting to other items in the supplemental. I'll need to vote no to register my objection to the business incentive fund transfer. Speaker 4: Thank you. Councilman Fox, Councilman Canete. Speaker 0: Thank you, Mr. President. We did have this supplemental in the Finance Committee and Councilwoman Fox touched on this very briefly in her comments. But we do, as a council, have an opportunity once there is a negotiation that's complete between the city and this party and there is some form of a contract or agreement, the final contract to disperse these funds would require council approval. I share that because I actually share Councilman Fox's skepticism about business incentives. For me, the issue is, are we investing in good jobs? Are we investing in, you know, livable wages and the kinds of jobs that are really going to help our citizens be good able to afford our city residents ? But I agree that that scrutiny is really important, and I am comforted by the fact that we will have a vote if and when this this company comes to agreement with the city. I respect Councilwoman Fox's decision to say no upfront, but I remind my colleagues that we'll have a second chance. And it is it's unusual to be asked to do this without knowing the company, but.

Speaker 1: Item 13 Report from Councilwoman Gonzalez, Councilman Andres, Councilmember Oranga Recommendation to Request City Manager to Work with Technology and Innovation 18 Library Services, Office of Equity and Community Stakeholders on a Digital Inclusion Master Plan. Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzales. Speaker 5: Yes. Thank you. I'd like to think my council colleagues, council member Muranga and Council Member Andrews for joining me on this item. I think it's very important, as we've talked in the larger scope of our technology masterplan, I know inclusive of that was a bullet point related to digital inclusion, but I wanted to make sure we brought this forward to really talk about it in depth. So now cities across America and the nation are experiencing a digital divide for various reasons. Whether it's technology as a whole, computer skills, affordable Internet service hardware for students. So many different things are being addressed. And any solution towards digital inclusion must involve connectivity, capacity, digital literacy and technology affordable, accessible computers. And so my office and I, we've been working we've been researching a package of items. This one is the first that will include a masterplan for digital inclusion overall. It's going to be a road map, and it'll request that the city manager work with various city departments. Much of what was already mentioned by our city clerk's team and a few of the stats here, according to the 2015 U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey, 28.7% of households in language do not have a fixed broadband subscription. And that is about roughly 120,000 residents, or the amount of people in the two council districts together who cannot reliably access the Web. So about 30 to 50000 households, if you can imagine, are off the grid. And these recommendations that we've included are important. And it doesn't just address seniors and children and individuals and households, but also small businesses that we know can increase sales and revenue with just an online platform, social media presence and of course, a Yelp page. This is the type of technical assistance and business improvement district that businessmen improvement districts excuse me can do on behalf of business owners in these areas. So as we know, we are in an age of Postmates and Uber eats and all of these different food delivery services. We know that it can be a great deal of help to these small businesses. And in the 908, when three we know that there's very high unemployment rates, we know that there's very high poverty levels, and that we know that many parents need jobs. So we must do a better job.

It collects maybe at any given year between 25000 to $30000 a year through the utility giving program. That's that's there.

And there has been the staff's recommendation, which I support, is to move the fund to the community foundation. They're willing to fundraise, manage the fund, and then maximize their work around homelessness to support that fund. And so I know it's something that that board strongly supports, and they believe they can significantly raise dollars as well as putting in their own matching dollars to work with the city on managing the fund instead of it being operated out of the health department.

As we have reported, the city of Long Beach has crime stats, have gaps, and we urge the council to fix them so you can do. The city of Long Beach, for example, does not list shootings in its official crime stats, but the city of Long Beach. But the city of Los Angeles does. L.A. residents can see every month how many shootings there were and where they were. They don't have to rely on Public Records Act requests to get neighborhood crime information. Long Beach buries it shootings with an aggravated assault, which is a category that includes various crimes. And the council can fix this. Any of you can. Agenda is an item for future use. It could be in the next week or so to begin listing shootings in long beaches. Official crime stats. We urge you to do so. Second, the city of Long Beach no longer lists serious part one Crimes against persons and property by Council District. The city used to routinely do that. It was easy for us to taxpayers to compare what's going on in Council District two with five and seven and nine. But that stopped. Elbe PD now only shows crimes by divisions north, south, east and west, which spans which spanned more than one council district and then invites confusion and misinformation. For example, in her official 2018 ballot statements. Councilwoman Mongo took credit for crime decreases that use numbers from East Division that included numbers from council districts three and four that weren't part of her council district and five reporting crimes by council district would end the confusion. If there are incumbents on this council who don't want the public to know the facts, let's find out who they are. Some council members should agenda is restoring reporting crimes by council districts. And third, this council needs to end the double standard.

The agenda item for you tonight consists of a handful of amendments that were continued from the City Council's March 5th meeting. The purpose of the Minutes amendments are to reflect the changes mandated by the California Coastal Commission's action last October when certifying the relevant ordinances. At last month's hearing, the City Council acted to continue that item directing staff to return with additional information related to accessory dwelling unit permits and lot size for the benefit of those who may not have been in attendance. A brief a very brief overview will be provided of the other ordinances, the first of which is the Alcoholic Beverage Beverage Manufacturing Ordinance, which was adopted by the City Council to streamline the permitting process. California Coastal Commission's amendment to this ordinance makes clear the parking requirement for office space that is equal to 25% of the gross floor area of the album use. The second. That batch of amendments is a compilation of changes necessary to create consistency between the zoning standards and Title 21 and the 2017 Training and Building Code Update, as well as the state's water efficiency standards. The California Coastal Commission made a number of amendments, including creating a new definition for demolish and rebuild. Among those changes make a recommendation that the definition of remodel and rebuild that was mandated for the coastal zone only be adopted as a citywide standard. As background. The Accessory Dwelling Unit ordinance was drafted in response to the completion that went into effect in January 2017, which invalidated the city's local adopted standards for A2 use. The local ordinance was crafted to provide local standards for the development of areas where possible to ensure that adus were developed in a manner compatible with the city's development pattern. The city map on the left illustrates the distribution of permits issued for youths since January. From January of 2017 to December 31st of 2018. The map gives us a snapshot of the distribution showing that districts 78 and nine have the greatest number of permits issued for 80 use. Of the permit trends that we see, approximately 10% of the permits are being issued for the legalization of unpermitted",

Speaker 7: The proposed bill would provide a local option for cities and towns to adopt a standardized pilot program that is modeled after the city of Boston's pilot program. For an On Our Cities Pilot program currently calls for tax exempt educational, medical and cultural organizations with property values in excess of 15 million to make voluntary payments equivalent to 25% of taxes that would be paid where they are not were they not tax exempt with half of the payment in cash and half through in-kind community benefit contributions. However, a public program lacks enforcement mechanisms, and many large institutions are out of compliance, with several continuously failing to meet their fully requested cash payments. Passage of a statute mandating pilot payments would afford Boston a mechanism to hold accountable the large institutions who call Boston home. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill and calling on the legislature to enact it. Mr. President, I seek to suspend the rules and passage of adoption of this resolution today after my co-sponsors have an opportunity to speak on it. Thank you. Speaker 0: Thank you, Counsel Brady. Would anyone else like to speak on this matter? The chair recognizes counsel, illusion. Constitution. You have the floor. Speaker 5: Thank you, Mr. President.

We have a climate crisis on our hands, an affordable housing crisis. Got to deal with repairing a lot of the harm policy harm that we've done here as a city. And so I think our institutions that are here that, you know, benefit from not being taxed, even though oftentimes they have very large endowments, should really be paying in to the capacity building that we have to do as a government to do the things that we have to do. So I support this bill, and I'm and I am glad to sign on to this resolution so that cities and municipalities can have a local option to tax institutions in their cities.

Now, that's not to say that there might not be ordinance provisions that are elsewhere in our code that would provide protections for LGBT x rays, others suspect classes of suspect classes. So we could do some more research and provide you with a better answer for that. But that's not what this that wouldn't be in this and organization for looking at the things they. I missed a little bit of the last bit, but I think you were talking about protected classes, including religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, race or color, which are I think all the class is protected under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. You. You're saying that our current short term rental ordinances is silent on any of the nationally protected classes? So I'm saying that in Chapter 33, the ordinances that that actually regulate short term rentals, we don't have any that's not in that ordinance provision in those ordinance provisions. That's not to say that we might not have ordinances, other ordinances, specifically with the city's discrimination ordinances, that would protect for those that would provide protections for those classes .

So currently under today's linkage fee accessory dwelling units are exempt.

So that is an existing exemption that we are proposing to carry through. Speaker 2: Carry through that already that currently exists, correct. Speaker 5: Do you know any other cities that would.

Speaker 2: Councilor Richardson. Speaker 5: Thank you, Mayor. So I think this is a pretty timely and a good conversation to have. We've been discussing diversity within our fire department for a number of years. I remember my first conversation with our new new chief. He told me this was going to be, you know, something really central to his agenda. And there's been a lot of work, you know, in the community as well. The recent graduates of the Economic Policy Impact Center, who I see are there and holding up signs. There's a little bit of work over the last few months and help publish a study on the very issue. And internally here within the city, our chief has done some pretty amazing work with our innovation team and taking on this issue of diversity as well. And and so so the goal tonight is to really hear about some of the efforts that are taking place to diversify our police, to power our fire department, and to sort of lift up. I noticed that that both reports, the economic policy impacts and a report in the chief's report both lift up the need to really have a full time person dedicated to focusing on diversifying and recruiting and really going deep into our community and recruiting. And so I wanted to lift that up. A city or a city our size, you know, with a, you know, a city where it's in a unique position where both our police chief fire chiefs are both Latino. And I remember hearing Chief Espino recount his early years in the field talking about the sense of ease the community felt when they received aid from responder who spoke the same language to them. I think these things are important. And so the idea tonight is we're going to hear presentation and I want and the motion here is going to recommend to the city manager to go ahead and explore how we can better support this effort by committing to a full time sworn diversity recruitment and partnerships manager within the department.

After a comprehensive public outreach process, we are ready to proceed with construction of our new two storey 4240 square foot concession stand. That would include the following amenities a new playground, equipment, rental space, outdoor dining areas, a new pedestrian promenade and rebuild beach public restrooms. The total project cost is estimated at $9 million and it is entirely funded by Tidelands funds. We anticipate beginning construction in April 2019, just a couple of months away and completing prior to summer of 2020. This project continues our efforts to revitalize our waterfront and aid and increase the youth and popularity for locals and visitors alike. The project will also help improve the safety of the immediate area and increase the recreational opportunities available. We are partnering with the Department of Economic Development to help us with the outreach and and bringing on board of new vendors. There is currently a request for proposals out in the streets. Those proposals to operate not just the Alameda locations, but some of our other beach concessions that are due in May.

This is for the amendment of a designation of a property at 1942, 1946, West 33rd Avenue is in Council District one and it is highlighted here in yellow. So the address is 1942, 1946, West 33rd Avenue. This is come came forward from the owner. It's a general location is at the corner of Tahoe in 33rd Avenue and the current zoning is max five. It's in the blueprint area of change. And so far on this, the entire yellow area is what is the existing Denver landmark. And they are looking to reduce it down to the red dashed area. This is a picture of the existing historic building. And on the right side is an empty parking lot that is part of the landmark designation application or part of the part of the existing landmark. So it was initially there was a mixed use residential apartment and grocery store that was constructed in 1892, and it's this highlighted there by the purple. This is a 1905 based map. Then the adjacent apartment building was constructed in 1895, and that is the existing Denver landmark. In about the 1980s, the mixed use building was demolished and condemned. And then in 1995, the lots that are noted in the lower map lots one, two, three and four highlighted in red were designated as a Denver landmark as a whole. And then in 2004, a non contributing garage was constructed. In 2015, the Landmark Preservation Commission approved a zone wide amendment that split the lot. And then in 2016, they approved the demolition of a non contributing garage. So they are currently looking to amend the boundary to remove the west portion of the property from the Denver landmarks. So Landmark Preservation Staff and the commission met all of the commission notices to the registered neighborhood organizations, notified and put signs up on the property for the Landmark Preservation Public Hearing. According to Chapter 30, any procedures to amend or rescind a designation are slightly different than the other designation. It goes to the Landmark Preservation Commission and typically they can terminate, change or recommend that it's forwarded for anything that is amendment.

He purchased a piece of property up in Sky Comet that I had my eye on for us to build as a community center and town. People said Councilmember Lambert may not be happy with you buying that piece of the property. And so we talked about it and he turned it into a amazing place that I couldn't be happier about. He took something that now was close to almost falling down and turned it into a beautiful place. And not only did he do that, but the workmanship in there, it was the two common arrows bridge that you took the lights from at an auction and put those lights in. He used crates from another business to redo the stairways. He left in the back of the building the marks on the ground where it used to be an old ice house. And so the marks from cutting up the ice were left on as part of the historical history of that building. There were so many pieces that showed absolute intricacies and devotion and love to the art of keeping this building alive. But he has done an awful lot or that building and for the town and that creativity that I saw as I went to the grand opening was spellbinding. And even the side of the building is now the back slat backsplash for the stove in the kitchen. And so the reuse was amazing. So I just really appreciate what you've done and I look forward",

Speaker 1: Has been moved and seconded. The required public hearing for Council Bill 247 is open. May we have the staff report? Speaker 12: Q So Jeffrey, it was CPD, so I have a rezoning request for a property located at Third and Knox in the Barnum neighborhood. So the property is located in Council District three. Again in the barn and neighborhood. So the request area is at the northeast corner of Third and Knox Court and the request area is about 0.6 acres. The rezoning is to go from ESU, D1 Ex to EMU 2.5 with a waiver. And I'll of course explain what that means. The purpose of the request is to accommodate multi-unit residential development on the site. So the subject said again, easy d1x. So that's urban edge context, single unit. And the D1 one x denotes that an accessory dwelling unit is allowed and the surrounding properties are also ESU, D1 x. So again, ESU, D1 exits a single unit, residential zone district, which does allow for accessory dwelling units. And importantly, the maximum building height is calibrated by the front and rear of the lot. So the front, 65% of the lot can be up to 2.5 storeys and actually up to 35 feet depending on the lot with the slots big enough to qualify for the 35 feet and the rear, 35% is one story and 17 feet in height. And so the requested zone district is IMU 2.5 A Sense for Urban Edge Multi-unit 2.5 stories. And I'll get to the waiver request here in a second. But I mean, 2.5 is a zone district that allows single and two unit and multi-unit residential with multi-unit residential typically being embedded with other residential areas. And it does allow for a variety of residential building forms up to 2.5 storeys. The building height is actually similar to the existing zoned district. And the anomaly here that we'll get to in the waiver is the apartment building form and actually only allows up to two stories in height in the front 65%. And so looking at the minimum loss size, it's a bit smaller than the current zone district, but importantly also to note the half storey definition. So 2.5 storey is the maximum height in the front, 65%. And so a half storey is defined as essentially a third story. That's 75% of the floor area of the story below it. So there's a massing reduction. Additionally, within the zone district, there's standards depending on the building form for upper storeys setbacks and setbacks to further reduce that massing.

The committee recommends the bill pass as amended. Speaker 0: Thank you so much. Councilmember Herbold, you are the chair of the committee, so I'm going to hand it over to you to provide this report. Speaker 4: Thank you so much. So much of what I'm going to say now is a repeat of this morning's comments. But for the public record and the viewing public, just want to go through the background and the the outcomes of this of our many months policy discussion around the ordinance that amendments to the ordinance that the Council passed back in June. So as context, there are currently no restrictions in the Seattle Municipal Code on the use of less lethal weapons. The Public Safety and Human Services Committee voted for one asset at our meeting on July 13th. At that time, I moved to hold it so that we would not hear it in full council until after the consent decree status conference that occurred last week. We wanted to make sure that in case the court weighed in at that status conference, that we would be informed by by the discussion happening at the status conference. The Court had no comment on the legislation in the status conference. And so I'm looking forward to our discussion and vote on it today. The legislation itself includes a full ban on acoustic weapons, directed energy weapons, blast balls, ultrasonic cannons and water cannons. The use of noise. Flash devices, otherwise known as flash bangs, are banned in demonstrations. The bill conditions, the use of pepper spray and pepper ball launchers on instances when the risk of serious bodily injury from violent actions outweighs the risk of harm to bystanders and separately from the conditions on pepper spray and pepper ball launchers. Tear gas is used allowed in even more narrow circumstances. The legislation does not regulate the use of non chemical launchers, for instance, beanbag rubber bullets, blue tip launchers. And so the there is there is no regulation in the code as relates to the use of those particular type of less lethal weapons. And that's important for folks who have raised questions about what less lethal weapons are available in instances where there is a threat of property damage. When we were in deliberations around this legislation, myself and Council President Gonzalez met with the consent decree monitor and the Department of Justice out of respect for the consent decree process and in with the objective of getting their feedback in advance of final cut council action. This was informal feedback to the formal consent decree process, which is yet to occur. The committee first did back in February after several",

It is a partnership between the city and the Building and Trades Council of Los Angeles and Orange County. It is a five year agreement and as Tom said, started in May 2015. It applies to covered construction projects over $500,000, and it has the benefits of providing labor peace. Its effort is on training by unions and preference to local residents. It does require contractors to hire new employees through the union. Speaker 0: Halls. Speaker 5: And provides local and disadvantaged veteran hiring preferences and goals. From the viewpoint of the contractors that we contract with for construction, the key play provisions are that the contractor must use labor from union groups within the Trade Council. There are core employee requirements that require the contractor to utilize and allows them to utilize up to five existing nonunion employees. But they must be employed on a 1 to 1 ratio with union hall referrals and all employees, if they're not part of the union, must pay temporary dues to the union. From the union.

For those who are not informed, the Colorado Department of Transportation is moving out of a couple of properties in the Virginia Village neighborhood and District six. They're building new facilities down by Mile High Stadium, and they've placed these two properties for sale. See that headquarters site? Most people have familiarity with at Arkansas, East Arkansas Avenue and South Birch Street. It's about 12 acres. The see that also has occupied the region one headquarters site at 2000 South Harley Street, a little bit smaller at 11 acres. See that was required by ordinance to offer these properties to other governmental entities first. And Denver entered into a competitive bidding situation. We felt I agreed with the administration. It's in Denver's best interests to try to control the disposition of these properties as much as possible. And a lot of hard work by our real estate department and Office of Economic Development. And we did secure the rights to negotiate on these properties. These four contracts that we have before us tonight have Denver facilitating the transfer of ownership of both locations from SEED out to an organization known as the Control Group. I see Jimmy Beloff us over here with his cards. You want to wave your hands at Mr. Belov so people can send you gifts and thank you cards along the way? The cost of the 11 acres on South Holly Street is 5.25 million. The property? The 12 acres on Arkansas in Birch. A bit more expensive coming in at 14 million. As I've stated since first hearing about the sale of these properties, I am very excited at the opportunity to help guide redevelopment of these sites, but I'm also very aware of the substantial challenges that these projects present. And in order for something to occur here that benefits the community rather than stifles it. It's going to take a real partnership between the developer and the city and the affected neighborhoods. The initial proposal over on South Holley Street involves construction of some 200 for sale three story townhomes, possibly 50 to 60 assisted senior housing units. The developer does not need a rezoning here. The existing IMX three zoning allows for this use, and while a public process is not required since the zoning is in hand, Castro has agreed to engage in a dialog with the community in an effort to arrive at a project that addresses as many of their needs and concerns as possible.

Speaker 4: Marina in the master plan. People speaking on behalf of the developer keep trying to justify the need for less spaces using numbers that do not reflect the demand. At the last council. Speaker 1: Meeting, we all heard about many. Speaker 4: People who had actively sailed their dry boats, stored boats and moved. Speaker 1: Their boats when they. Speaker 4: Were started telling everybody to move out and because they were. Speaker 0: Going to start their. Speaker 4: Big housing development. For now, the phasing in the building plan allows many to keep their boats in the dry storage at Alameda Marina at the Eastern End for several years. And so the severe need will not really become apparent until it's time for that last phase to be built. The developer has offered to install up to 120 versa docks in the wet slips and charge the same. Speaker 1: Fee as for the. Speaker 4: Dry storage prices for those spaces. If this happens, we might have enough dry boat storage at the expense of the wet slips in the marina at $10,000 per versa. Dock. It is hard to imagine that they will not increase.

But the city also shouldn't be happy with this plan because the city earns 10% on the fees that are collected. So Andrew Thomas had a very good idea of potentially using six acres of the Thailand's trust space and sale terminals for dry storage. And this is reflected in the master plan of Alameda Marina.

It's kind of a civics lesson. It starts with residents contacting their councilman with concerns over El Nino or predictions of an El Nino season coming forward. And these concerns were legit. Many fourth District residents remember the flooding of 1995, and nearly all of them remember the flooding of January 19th, 2010 along the Atherton, Carter and Termino corridor. And they really. Speaker 6: Didn't put it together that. Speaker 8: We did $25 million worth of infrastructure improvements since that time. But, you know, the average resident doesn't remember the context. So what we did is we held a community meeting and I invited Reggie Harrison to come out and speak to our community group. And that went so well that I decided to agenda is that for a committee meeting, I happened to chair the Environmental Committee, and since El Nino is an environmental issue, we brought it forward to the Environmental Committee and Mr. Harrison enhanced his presentation and ended it there. That brings us to where we are here tonight. And this is a presentation of our El Nino preparedness for the entire city council.

Thank you, Mayor and Council members, for this opportunity to provide an update on the city's response and recovery plans for preparations for the El Nino winter storms. The city of Long Beach has staff and all of US departments take seriously the predictions of El Nino induced heavy rains, high tides and rip currents. This winter, we urge all residents to also take these predictions seriously. Typically, Long Beach receives about 12 to 15 inches of rain annually. Predictions for this winter are that we will receive 20 to 30 inches almost double the amount of rainfall that we receive in an average year. Flooding is predicted as storms are expected to occur in succession, causing the grounds to saturate. However, even as we receive this amount of rain, it is not expected to impact the four year drought that we are experiencing. Speaker 1: This. Speaker 11: So the El Nino refers to a warming of the Pacific Ocean off the coast of South America.

Speaker 4: Agenda item three Council Bill 119 658 Relating to Rental Agreements Committee recommends that they'll pass. Speaker 3: Councilmember Herbold This bill prohibits a landlord from seeking damages from a tenant or a household member who has experienced domestic violence so long as they have provided written documentation to the landlord, signed by a qualified third party, stating in the in the statement that the tenant or household member reported to a qualified third party that they are a victim of domestic violence and the name of the perpetrator that caused the violence. This qualified third parties can be law enforcement, health professionals, court employees, licensed mental health professionals, or advocates for crime, victim or witness programs. The time, date and location of the act of domestic violence that relate resulted in the property damage and a brief description of the property damage. These are all the contents of this third party report. This was modeled off of the principle of of limiting liability that is already established in state tenant law, which allows a survivor to terminate a lease before the end of the term of the lease without penalty. The key provision of this legislation is that the survivor should not be held liable for damages caused by their abuser. This bill specifically states that when perpetrators cause damage to a unit, it is they who are responsible for that damage. Advocates with the coalition ending gender based violence insisted that we structure the reporting requirements to maintain anonymity of the perpetrator in reporting to mitigate the risk of retaliation. This is a best practice in the gender based violence advocacy and support to ensure safety. And it preserves the agency of a survivor to make. Decisions that deeply impact their lives. Hopefully, my colleagues here received an email last Thursday from the Coalition speaking to this point. This provision of protecting the anonymity of the perpetrator while limiting the liability of the survivor created a practical challenge for the bill that many constituents and advocates representing landlords expressed, namely, namely, the question of a landlords ability to recoup their damages. To respond to this challenge with the support of the Rental Housing Association, the Multifamily Housing Association and tenants rights organizations like Washington can in the Housing Justice Project and the Coalition, we introduced a landlord mitigation fund modeled after a similar resource used in the state to help landlords in these scenarios. Speaker 1: Great. Thank you. Catherine Herbold, Councilmember Bagshaw. Speaker 6: Thank you, Councilmember Herbold. Thank you for bringing this forward and I appreciate our conversation this morning.

Speaker 1: It has been moved and seconded and the public hearing for Constable four, four, seven is open. May we have the staff report? Speaker 5: Just cleaning it up. All right. Speaker 11: I'm Alice, Stevie. And this is a proposed rezoning for 1245 Queen Street. We are in Council District five in the East Colfax neighborhood. The subject property is a little over 7000 square feet, and the proposed rezoning is from the current Eastside X to Eastside one x. So the difference being that the proposed district allows an accessory dwelling unit, including the detached accessory dwelling unit building form, the subject property and surrounding properties in all directions are Eastside X transitioning to Main Street zoning along Colfax to the north, and similarly the site and surrounding properties are single unit residential land use with a few public , quasi public and higher intensity residential uses in the area. So the subject properties on the bottom left and some surrounding residential buildings are shown on the right. So Planning Board recommended approval of this rezoning. On May 1st, KPD received a statement of support from the East Colfax Neighborhood Association. As of the time of the staff report, we also received 18 letters or emails and support two in our position and one comment that was neither in support or opposition. The support letters included 14 forms circulated by the applicant, returned by neighbors to indicate their support. And then we. A protest petition was submitted for this case with valid signatures of the owners of just over 20% of the area within 200 feet of the subject property. So for the rezoning criteria, we have four plans to consider in this area. The proposed rezoning is consistent with comprehensive plan 2040 and that it will enable increased development at a location where infrastructure, where infrastructure, including transit service, is already in place. Blueprint Denver mapped this area as the urban edge context. The requested ESU D1 X is consistent with the planned direction of predominantly residential areas that are generally single unit and two unit uses. The requested ESU D1 X is consistent with the future places mapping of this area of low residential, which is single into unit and accessory dwelling dwelling units are appropriate. So under the blueprint growth strategy areas including the subject property are expected to see 10% of job growth and 20% of housing growth by 2040. The additional accessory dwelling unit permitted by the proposed rezoning is consistent with that and additionally, blueprint includes a policy to diversify housing choice with the expansion of accessory dwelling units throughout all residential areas. One strategy that specifically references how this policy applies to rezoning is, quote, a citywide approach to enable",

While the composition of the Commission and Appointment Procedure was contained in the Charter Amendment language, the Charter section entitled Staff Assistance and Budget reads Staffing for Administrative and management functions of the Commission will be addressed in the Municipal Code. The Commission will have a budget as determined by the City Council sufficient to conduct the Commission's mission and business. Therefore, Council, we must take action, further action through an ordinance and budget appropriation before the Ethics Commission can convene.

That plan was approved by the Council in April 2019 originally, and this plan provides detailed information about Council's funding expectations in each of the four areas that I just previously outlined and March 27, the mayor issued an emergency order that would provide emergency child care services to essential workers, as defined by the Washington Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction. These workers include health care workers, first responders, pharmacy workers, and Grocery Store Workers. Council Bill 119771 was originally transmitted to us by the Mayor's Office and the Department of Education and Early Learning. This legislation would amend the Families in Education, Preschool and Promise Levy Implementation and evaluation plan to include temporary emergency child care services for essential or frontline essential workers consistent with a mayor's emergency order that was issued on the 27th of March.

Recommendation to request city attorney to prepare an ordinance amending the Long Beach Municipal Code to prohibit the sale of all flavored tobacco products citywide. Speaker 3: Turning it over to the staff or the city attorney have a report or comment on this. Speaker 0: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. We'll have a staff report from Kelly Collopy, our director of Health and Human Services. Speaker 5: Good evening, Honorable Mayor and Council Members. Thank you for this opportunity to discuss the request to establish an ordinance to prohibit the sale of all flavored tobacco products except for hookah lounges and premium cigars under certain conditions. A December 3rd, 2019, the City Council adopted Chapter 5.9 for the Long Beach Municipal Code, a temporary prohibition of the sale of certain flavored tobacco products, including flavored cigarillos, flavored electronic smoking devices, flavored electronic smoked smoking device fluid and menthol cigarets. As of January 4th, 2021, this has expired. We thank Councilwoman Price for bringing this item forward in 2019 and first supported this Council to pass that temporary measure. In August 2020, the California Legislature passed Senate Bill 793 to ban the sale of flavor tobacco products statewide. The ban prohibits the sale of all flavored tobacco products in California, with the exemption of hookah and premium cigars under certain circumstances. The Senate bill is more comprehensive than the temporary ban that was implemented in Long Beach, covering a wider array of flavored tobacco products such as flavored smokeless tobacco products. Senate Bill 793 was slated for implementation starting on January 1st, 2021. However, implementation has been postponed pending the outcome of a referendum planned slated for 2022. Statewide election. As of December 2020 over 60 jurisdictions in California currently have taken action independent of state action to regulate the sale of flavored tobacco products, and many more are currently working on ordinances at this time. Cities such as Beverly Hills and Manhattan Beach have banned the sale of all tobacco products. Our Health and Human Services Department strongly recommends that the City Council take immediate action to adopt a permanent prohibition of the sale of all flavored tobacco products in the city, except for hookah rounders and premium cigars under certain conditions, as outlined in Senate Bill 793 to protect the public health of our community. We recommend this based on compelling data regarding youth utilization of flavored nicotine products. Impacts of nicotine to the youth brain and health. The Future Addiction. Based on early use of these products, it's essential to take immediate action for the safety of our youth. Nationwide, youth e-cigarette usage has grown nearly 20 fold in less than ten years, increasing from 1.5% in 2011 to 23.6%, including nearly 5% of middle school students in 2020.

Speaker 0: Communication from Councilwoman Prices and House Pierce and Vice Mayor Andrew's recommendation to request an ordinance amending the Long Beach Municipal Code to write the closing of the boathouse lane parking lot from one hour after sunset until 8 a.m. daily. Speaker 2: Councilman Price. Speaker 5: Mayor. So I want to make a few modifications to this ordinance before we open it up for public comment. The first is I'd like the modification to be that access to the lots is limited between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m. because we do have a rowing facility located right there and we want to make sure that we accommodate the hours and the programing that takes place by the tenants that occupy that facility in terms of access to the water and access to recreation. So I'd like to direct that. And then I also want to point out that earlier today, this afternoon, we received a letter from the Coastal Commission with some recommendations in terms of things for us to keep in mind as we're drafting the ordinance. So I would like to make sure that the city attorney through this motion drafts an ordinance that's consistent with the timelines indicated in my motion and is consistent with the Coastal Commission recommendations, and that they have the conversations with Coastal Commission staff to ensure that access to this area is not restricted and that the ordinance come back to council so that we can start the process. I do want to highlight for my council colleagues where this request is coming from, as some of my colleagues may or may not be aware. We do have different operating hours in various coastal areas in the city of Long Beach and we want to make sure that we modify the hours of operations for the parking lots adjacent to Boathouse Lane to be consistent with some of the others along Marine Stadium. Boathouse Lane is located immediately adjacent to a residential community called Spinnaker Bay. And based on the calls for service that we've seen with the police department and the increase in the calls for service that we have seen there, the nuisance activity and the instances of criminal activity have really seen an increase in recent times. And that has a lot to do with people congregating late night in those parking lots. And so we want to make sure that people continue to have both bike and pedestrian access 24 hours a day to that coastal area. But that just like we do in many of our other beach lots, that the hours of operation for the parking lots are limited to reflect what we have available now at Marine Stadium and similar areas. So that's the background. I know there's a number of residents who want to residents and and members of the community who use the recreational facility who want to speak. And I just I want to",

Our finest moment. Jon GROSS is with us tonight. And this is something that he's been working on at some time. I know it's been something that the city council has been trying to achieve for quite some time, and I think we're close to being there. So, John, thank you. Honorable mayor and council members. I don't often get to do anything as exciting as this is on the surface. We're recommending a contract for award to Cooper America West for payment processing. And payment processing is a a kind of a boring operation where they process credit cards and debit cards and check payments for city bills. But this is exciting because we're also making a staff recommendation to eliminate the convenience fee paid by utility customers to use use credit and debit cards and E checks. And the use of credit and debit cards to our customers will then be free for utility customers when they make payments. Right now, these utility customers pay $3.75 if they pay by credit or debit card and $0.95 that they pay by. E check. This will now be no charge and those completely free services will encourage more use of our fast and easy internet and telephone payment services. And we will now be able to offer mobile payment options on your phones at no additional cost. The overall cost of this contract, in addition to all that, is lower than the previous contract. When we look at the combined cost to the both the customer and of the city, however, by the city absorbing the convenience fees, the city utilities, not the general fund, but the city utilities that is refused gas and water will have an increased cost estimated at about $720,000 a year. Those extra costs will be absorbed into the normal cost of doing business. And I want to point out that that's very similar, if not identical, to the way the city already handles the cost of processing cash payments and the check payments that we receive for utilities. Those extra and those credit card costs, those are projections that could be higher if uses are higher. Overall, we believe that Cooper will be an excellent service provider, and we are very pleased to make the recommendation to eliminate utility convenience fees. That's the end of my report.

An ordinance relating to the 2015 budget amending ordinance 124648, which adopted the 2015 budget, changing appropriations to the Seattle Department of Transportation and to the Human Services Department, creating both exempt and nonexempt positions. Authorizing the Director of Finance to enter into an interlocal agreement with the State Department of Licensing in ratifying and confirming certain prior acts, all by at least a three quarter vote of the City Council held on May 18th, 2015. Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Rasmussen. Speaker 1: Thank you. You'll recall that we held this council bill at the last council meeting in order to develop language for an amendment to the legislation, which will help to ensure that we closely watched and monitor the cost of administration of the vehicle license fee rebate. As I know all of you know, the city was fortunate to have Proposition one passed last November, which authorized a $60 increase in the vehicle license fee and a 1/10 of 1% increase in the sales tax in Seattle. And this will allow the increase of about 230,000 new transit hours of service in Seattle. And the first increase in service will occur in June. And then the second round of increasing of services will occur in September. What this legislation does is amend the 2015 budget of the city of Seattle, and this has to be done in order to implement the new bus service coming. It has $31 billion in 2015 appropriation to the Department of Transportation to reflect the new revenues coming to the city through the Transportation Benefit District, and 1/10 of 1% sales tax increase and a $60 vehicle license fee increase revenue. That also adds to new positions to the Department of Transportation to help manage the new transit service the city is purchasing from Metro. The Department of Transportation positions are critical to ensure that the city has sufficient staff to monitor and oversee the use of city funds and to ensure the supplanting of city of dollars does not occur when the service begins. Of the $31 million in revenues that are being added to the city's budget, 278,000 will go to our Human Services Department Utility Discount Program, which will be responsible for administering the vehicle license fee rebate program. I know that a number of council members had concerns about this level of funding going to the Human Services Department because it allows the funding of four and a quarter full time equivalent positions over the next seven months to process and distribute what is estimated by the executive to be 20,000 vehicle license fee rebates. The concern that I have is that there are only a total of 17,000 households now enrolled in the utility discount program, which is the program for low income customers.

So I think we've again, this is follow up legislation accountable 118999 that we pass on June 14th, where we basically put a proviso in, as Councilmember Burgess stated, to appropriate $2.3 million solely for SDR to fund one time only transportation services for us out of public schools and maybe spent for no other purpose. And again, in order to use school safety, traffic and pedestrian improvement funds, this legislation allows us to amend our code to allow for that bus transportation. You know, during during the discussions, we sort of made it clear that, you know, the policy regarding Bill Times three, tier two tier is solely responsibility of public schools and they do furnish this with information. School transportation funding is the responsibility of school district safety. And I think based on our discussion this morning during our briefing, we reiterated the fact that the state must fully fund basic education, which includes transportation costs. But but at the end of the day, we also are incredibly concerned about safety, and we make a lot of investments towards safety. And so that's what this investment is all about.

This is, I believe, a very important time in the discourse to ensure that there's confidence in government institutions. On this item, I want to be very clear is meant to be the beginning of a discussion that will hopefully make a lasting, lasting reforms to our governance here in the city of Long Beach. From the national to the local level, there has been a clear erosion in confidence in our government institutions, and voter turnout is a key indicator of that. Long Beach has tried to address these issues before. A little bit of history. The Long Beach City Council created an ethics task force in 2001 approving a proposal by then council member Bonnie Lowenthal. And that that as the ethics task force was comprised of many people who were continuing to serve in government today. They presented a report and recommendations in 2002. The City Council also adopted a code of ethics in 2003. We made we made some progress. In a discussion of charter reform, the city council approved establishing an Ethics Commission and redistricting commission in 2007. However, those issues were not those items were not successful on the ballot because they were combined with other issues that were far more controversial. And so it's important to note that every major city in California has an ethics commission or an Office of Equity, and they include Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, Berkeley and Oakland . Cities that we base a lot of our policies on here as a city, these commissions handles duties ranging from conflict of interest, campaign finance, city campaign laws, lobbying, government ethics and including enforcement in some cases. And so I think the time has come for us to have a really serious conversation about improving our ethics laws and codifying them in our governance here in the city of Long Beach. Long Beach also has had numerous divisive experiences with redrawing council district lines. In 2011. It was polarizing and politically charged. The process was polarizing and very politically charged. Hundreds of residents turned out at community meetings about the proposed lines. Lawn signs went up and throughout some neighborhoods, and it was not a pretty sight. In 2008, our state adopted a independent redistricting commission model that",

Just to make a clarification, this budget action does not actually fund the programs. It simply funds the social justice project to to move forward with their identification of programs that will then receive this funding. The way they do this work is the social justice fund has a giving project where they bring together a multiracial group of 15 to 25 people who work together over the next six months to build community with one another, develop a shared analysis of race and class, and then make strategic grants based upon a competitive funding process which will follow the council's vote today.

After attending the 2016 Black Prisoners Caucus Legislative Summit last month at Cleveland Bay Prison. I challenge myself to ensure that the city does more to support criminal justice reform efforts. This funding will allow the communities most impacted by our failed tough on crime laws to actually be participants in transformative policy reform that will help lay the foundation for the city to achieve zero detention for juveniles.

I want to find out an update as it as it has been, a significant expenditure.

Speaker 8: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I'd like to make the motion to move this item. And I want to thank my co coauthors as well on this item. We have. Sorry, I have to adjust my seat. We have numerous reports from cities regarding the growing gap between the rich and the poor. I don't think that's a surprise to anyone while the economy is certainly improved. For many of us, it hasn't improved. For all of us and various investors and companies in certain lucrative sectors continue to accumulate wealth. Cities and counties. What ends up happening is we are left to deal with the impacts of a growing class of residents living in poverty. Throughout the years that many of us have been on this council, we have noted that our city tends to be a tale of two cities, and I think that continues to be palpable here in our city , even when many of us have. Experienced an increase in our economic benefits, increase in our household income. We don't see that across the board. What ends up happening when cities and counties are left with the burdens of this disparity that exist among those living in poverty? It affects our health. It affects our housing. It affects emergency services, which ends up costing more tax dollars to be used in a reactive manner rather than proactively through people's wages and in the local economy. As a result, the subject of minimum wage is being discussed and decided upon in numerous state and local council chambers throughout the nation, including the county and the city of Los Angeles. So Long Beach, as a city, doesn't have the luxury nor the reputation for shying away from this conversation. It's at our doorstep and it's here. Whether all of us like it or not, it is at our doorstep. I believe that the mayor, as well as my co-sponsors and I wish to approach this issue in a methodical and logical manner. We welcome any conversation that may improve the health and well-being of our residents. But we also believe there's another element to be considered here, and that's the impact on small businesses and nonprofits. That's why this study has another component to determine whether incentives or fee reductions could help local businesses. In as much as we have economic engines such as",

Burt Dan's lived in the Forest Park neighborhood for more than 35 years, where he's worked to support our neighborhood beautification, enhanced civic engagement. And then he certainly fostered a lot of community in the neighborhood. He has a number of accomplishments, including a one day Christmas store. This this is a grant program that happens every year. It provides gifts to over 30,000 Long Beach residents in need. The back, back to the Future North Long Beach History Project is another. He's been a member of a number of organizations in the north, in North Beach, past and present. The North North Project Area Committee for Redevelopment. He was an original member of the Veterans Day parade. One of his greatest, proudest accomplishments is having partnered with former council member Jerry Schulz to really take this patch of land that we see here that really was, you know, just that underutilized patch and work together with the community to beautify it. And he he helps to maintain it even today, the South Street Parkway. So as you can see, it was a random vacant lot, but he's really turned it into a beautiful space in the community. You know, I was fortunate to officiate he and Holly's renewal of their vows. And we had a we had a great celebration right there in that space. It's really an example of placemaking.

Speaker 6: So I'm Andrew Ross with Denver Department of Environment, Public Health and Environment. Yeah. So EPA came through and did the soil testing of residential soils between about 2000 and 2007, sort of a staggered approach. Speaker 3: But they did it again in 2012 and 13. Correct. Speaker 6: And they did do some follow up sampling in 2012. 2013, correct. Speaker 3: Okay. And what was that for? Speaker 6: That was just confirmation sampling of properties that hadn't been remediated. Okay. Speaker 3: My understanding and for those properties that were refused, what what was the what did the EPA do? Speaker 6: Oh, I don't have the numbers in front of me. How many people refused? But EPA went through their Superfund process recently. They called it a finding of significant differences, is the terminology. And they've decided that those properties will just not be cleaned up because those homeowners have refused to clean up. Okay. We'll leave it in the neighborhood of 10 to 12 residences. Speaker 3: Okay. So it's gone down quite a bit. So we had a number of residents talk about the testing. Talk about the soil. And I wanted to hone in on the three borings along the 39th Avenue Channel that Kim Morse, Jennifer Eder kind of talked about. But I know that there's been a discrepancy from the administration. So can you talk about the number of borings that you have tested along the 39th Avenue Channel? Speaker 6: Sure. So keep in mind, we can only test properties that we have legal access to. So starting in 2016, we took 33 samples along the entire project through city owned right away. And we followed that up last summer. Same right away with 38 more samples. So we've taken 71 total in city owned right away properties. In terms of the private parcels that the city is now acquiring. We're doing environmental due diligence sampling on all those properties. The city didn't start acquiring those properties until November. Mm hmm. And so we've been working through those properties as the city acquires them, and we haven't gotten any of that data back yet.

The Gateway Village 2022 Budget proposes overall expenditures of 1,295,000 and transfers to the capital fund of 800,000, with total revenues of $739,392. These are plans to assess 20 mills on real property within the district during 2022. The district anticipates funding a reserve study to develop a long term plan for replacement of its major capital items, fund streetlight improvements to improve safety at night and potentially start the third phase of the district's landscape improvement project. Additionally, the district plans to plan to continue landscaping, irrigation, maintenance, snow removal and storm drainage maintenance and storm drainage maintenance within the district. City staff has reviewed the 2022 budget work plan and recommends it for approval. Thank you. Speaker 1: Thank you, Michael. This evening we're still want to just give. A little bit of time.

We have two applications before you tonight, two separate applications. These are design review applications. One, as the clerk so ably described as on Shoreline Drive. The other is on Saint Charles Street. These are two totally separate applications, but we're going to handle them together because the issues are all very similar. These are antennas by wireless telecommunication facilities for essentially cell phones and data transmission here in Alameda. These projects, these two individual projects, both came to the city at around the same time. City staff reviewed the applications. And through our role as essentially a surrogate for the planning board, we approved design review applications for small projects around the city US. These wireless communications facilities are examples of the kinds of things that are approved at the staff level fairly regularly. We approve approximately 2 to 3 design reviews every week downstairs in the planning department. These all occur with though with public notice, the neighbors who have an opportunity to comment on the applications before we take action . And then what we do is we report our actions to the planning board at their next meeting. Both of these applications generated a number of comments from the neighbors. We went ahead and approved them anyway and then with conditions. And then the planning board, because of concerns raised by the neighbors, called it for review. So the planning board held a public hearing in April, at which time they considered the merits of these two applications, and after their public hearing, they went ahead and re-approved them also with conditions. Then the City Council, you exercised your right to call that decision for review. So this is the third time we'll be looking at these these items. Both of these applications are the result of a decision by the Alameda Unified School District to discontinue cell towers and cell facilities on school facilities on the school district as a property owner made the decision that they did not want to have these types of facilities on their on their buildings. So they have to be shut down and they have to be moved by these cell tower operators. And in this case, we're talking about AT&T as the applicant and owner of both facilities.

Politicians love to use the phrase Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. It's a phrase we hear so often. It's literally lost its meaning. Those words need to be backed up by action. And this is what we're doing here today. As many of you know, total wine and spirits. A major commercial retailer was recently awarded a liquor license to operate one of their major chain locations right here in Boston, despite opposition from local elected officials, community groups, abutters and neighboring small businesses. How is it that something so universally unwanted can pass through? Without question, especially when you know how deep the inequities are in our liquor license system. To begin with, this is why we're filing a tax amendment to establish a retail formula use in our zoning code. The purpose of this tax amendment is to define what major commercial chains look like. It is also to ban them from being allowed to set up shop in residential zones. And we would and would make their development commercial zones conditional. This is a tax amendment which was originally filed by my sister and service councilor Edward Janey and then Councilor Wu. It was ultimately vetoed by the Walsh administration. But given that one of the original co-sponsors is now across the hall in the Eagle Room, I think our chances of passing this have improved. We look forward to this conversation and doing more to stand up for small businesses in our city. Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilman. Here. Would anyone else like to speak on this matter? I see. Councilor Edwards, the chair, recognizes Councilor Edwards. Speaker 2: Thank you very much. And it's true. At the time, we were dealing with Starbucks in the North End, specifically focusing on the concerns of big box stores, being able to out do move faster then and locate and small in our neighborhoods and therefore hurt our small business owners. I want to be very clear that that there was no passage of this ordinance, there was no veto by whilst the issue was legal and case law that demonstrated that zoning codes actually cannot favor small businesses over big box stores. So we tried the zoning amendment, but we were met with case law. And I can send that case law to the drafter of this ordinance. So what we will need is either a favorable case decision coming out of land court demonstrating that we can do this in our zoning courts and our zoning code, or we will need to draft this in such a way that it cuts. It helps",

This is for acquisition of a property that has historically been used as a community correction facility in the city of Denver. As you know, we had a vote that changed the contracts, and I was in agreement with the policy issue of divesting from the two companies that run ICE facilities around the country. However, this is putting more money back into the same pockets of those companies, one of those companies that we are divesting from. I know we are working aggressively to try to solve long term solutions for through zoning and through the work of a work group trying to figure out what are those solutions. And I know this is part of one of those steps, but I'm not in agreement that we should be. There was no RFP process on this, and just because this one property became available, then we just automatically moved to acquire it.

There we go. As you recall, the first three phases were implemented beginning in September of 2018. Phase that was for city owned facilities and events. Phase two is for large food service providers, defined as 101 seats or more so very large restaurants. And phase three was small food providers of less than 100 seats or less. And that last phase just went into effect in December of last this past year. In October of this past year, we gave a presentation updating the city council as to the progress we've made.

I submitted a letter to the city clerk late this afternoon, and I would like to read it so that it can be a matter of public record. Dear Council members to serve on the Planning Board is an honor and a privilege and a wonderful way to perform one's civic duty. I consider myself quite fortunate to have experienced this type of community service firsthand, and for that I will be forever grateful. It became clear during my days as a planning board member that those appointed to the Planning Board should have an ability to listen to opposing views while keeping a clear focus on where the real public interests lie. What was not only within the law, but also really fair, and the ability to distinguish between fact and opinion with the position one needed to assemble information from both written and oral testimony and apply it to the making of meaningful recommendations that were based upon adopted plans, ordinances, required findings of fact and established policies, and not upon personal values. Therefore, the letters written to convey my disappointment in the wording found in the Planning Board applications submitted by Sandy Sullivan on June 15th, 2015. Specifically the comment made in the other comments section of Ms.. Sullivan's application. I am not a realtor. I found this comment unnecessary and inappropriate, and because I am a realtor personally offensive. In some cities, it is a requirement that at least one of the members of a planning board commission be a representative from a community group that participates in land use issues. On a personal note, and as a lifelong Alameda resident, I believe in individual. Taking a leadership position on a city board should not make disparaging remarks towards other members of the community as a validation of their qualifications. To appoint an individual that demonstrates the same attitude is not the best interest of our residents in our city. Therefore, instead of appointing Mr. Sullivan, I am asking you to submit another nominee for the position of Planning. Board Member. Thank you for your time and consideration. Speaker 0: Walt Jacobs.

This is an item that I've actually been thinking about for quite a bit of time now. We have been told since day one of this pandemic in mid-March that the city council really has no standing. To weigh in on the issues regarding the openings and the closures of our small businesses, the conduct prohibitions of our residents in terms of social distancing and mask wearing at that, and that those issues are within the exclusive sovereign purview of the health department. Now we've been told that, and I think as a council we have heeded that guidance and we have all been extremely respectful of that directive. However, all around us, we have seen cities and other legislative bodies take action on issues related to the health orders, whether it be mask wearing requirements, whether it be the opening and closure of certain business sectors. Or whether it be the opening and closure of certain recreational opportunities. Now, while I understand the importance and the need for us to make sure that the pandemic is at the forefront of our thoughts and our policy making, and the public safety and and public health of our residents is at the forefront of our decision making. I brought this item because I want further clarification on why it is that the Long Beach City Council cannot weigh in on issues which seem to be issues that other city councils and legislative bodies are weighing in on. And so I'm asking for a report back from the city attorney with a legal clarification of why it is that the city council cannot be at the table when we're talking about openings, closures, mask requirements and other such things that we are seeing other legislative bodies throughout the region weigh in on. And so that's the background of this item. And really it's more of an educational item than anything else. I think all of us on the city council want to defer to our city manager, want to defer to our city attorney and our health department to lead us. But we are in a situation where we have businesses that are literally having to shut their doors forever, incurring major debt in order to be able to pay their bills. And we are not in any position to help them. We are powerless, according",

So I'd like to say I'm so very excited. It's a very special evening because we have Karen Dhesi here, as well as many of our fellow many of my fellow board members. And it is a fantastic way to celebrate them through National Arts Month, which is October. In addition, if many of you did not know, they are actually our very own theater company. The ACT International City Theater has been a leader in the live theater world for over 30 years. In addition, this year they have not one, not only one, ten, 25 or 30 thereabout, almost 40 awards, basically envying theaters such as the Center Theater Group in L.A., the Geffen in L.A. and the South Coast Rep, among many others. And I'm so very proud to present them with a recognition today and also bring them up to say a few words I'd love to have carried up to the podium. We also have a presentation via video as well, and I hope we can get it right for you. So thank you so much. Speaker 1: I'm Karen Deci, artistic director, producer of International City Theater. I want to thank Mayor Garcia and the Honorable Council as well for allowing me a couple of minutes to talk a little bit about these awards stage. Since L.A. recently announced their awards and I received almost 40 awards and one of the most important was named Best Larger Theater. And we were named we of South Coast Rep, the Geffen and the Center Theater Group in Los Angeles. As you can imagine, our budget is much smaller, but and we are the only company our size that was included for that award. And also last year, if you didn't know the L.A. Drama Critics Circle Award gave us outstanding season, and that's out of hundreds of theaters in L.A. and Orange County. Why is this important? Quality work enables us to attract extraordinary talent. I'm talking about actors with Broadway credits, television and film. Why is this important for Long Beach? I and other cultural organizations play an important role in the city's future development. Residents seeking an urban urban experience need things to do. I City is also an economic partner with the number of jobs we give annually more than 150 for artist, SMG employees and ancillary businesses, graphics, printing, etc.. We also serve our community with six education programs that's in every district, all nine districts from elementary school age to low income seniors.

And, Councilman Brooks, you have a comment? Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. This bill came through a health and safety committee, which I chair and had an extensive conversation with Judge Mancusi. And in conversation with the committee, what this bill does is brings the public defender in-house. Currently, we contract and outsource our public defender, which causes a couple of problems. One, the outsourcing has been rising in costs every year. And we have not been a we haven't been able to get a detailed report as to why those costs have been rising this way. We have it in house and we have control over our costs. It's one, two. We can continue to train our public defenders so that our public gets the best lawyers in the business. And so that's important to have. And so, you know, I'm going to be supporting this. I encourage colleagues that were not in committee and did not get a chance to watch this session to to reach out to Judge Marcus Mackey. He will gladly sit down with you.

Hello, Mayor and City Council. My name is Jordan. Shame on you. Your behavior is beyond unacceptable. Not only is the institution of policing fundamentally racist, but our BPD is a prime example. In addition, our police department honors and rewards officers involved in wrongful death and excessive force cases. Public records demonstrate that BPD showers, high pay, promotions and awards on its most violent and aggressive members. And in May, Long Beach City attorney Charles Parkin reported that the city has spent more than $31 million since 2014 to settle 61 excessive force and wrongful death claim lawsuits. Reimagining safety is about upending the imbalance of power and holding accountable those officers who act violently with impunity. This is all covered in the recent fourth article about the amount of money that is given out every year or over the past several years in these settlements. I have to ask, what do you expect to change if you're still giving this department a slush fund to cover all their murders? Why would they ever stop killing people if it's all covered and you get promoted if you kill or hurt someone? How does that disincentivize officers from reproducing this harm? Defund the police and take a bold stand against police violence, divest from BPD and invest differently in our community. Health and safety. Thank you. That concludes public comment for this item.

Speaker 5: All right, I'll recognize the motion. So moving in motion often. John Allen went off the air before. Speaker 6: Thank you so much. And so I just wanted to bring this motion forward. This item aims to understand the impact of eliminating the cannabis cultivation tax in Long Beach. Well, actually, since voters passed the measure in May in 2016, our city's cannabis cultivation businesses have been charged $12 for every square foot of product under cultivation. They also pay $161 per pound of dried cannabis flower to the state over the tax overtaxation. Obviously can be a barrier for potential cultivators and is a burden to current operators in our city's cannabis industry. So I'm told fees associated with cannabis cultivation also affect profits for businesses. I'm sorry. They they affect profits for businesses. Wages for a local workforce. And prices for consumers. Further, there's no precedent for this tax. No other industry in Long Beach is taxed based on the cultivation of its products. Imagine taxing local farmers for every fruit or vegetable harvested. Not only would private the profits of prices at your local farmers markets increase, but the grower is essentially being fined for successfully growing food. The only groups subjected to this tax are local cannabis cultivators who should not face additional obstacles because of what they decide to grow and the crop that they grow. Previous the reduction of cannabis business license taxes approved by this Council in 2019 led to an uptick in active non-retail licenses and likely contributed to a match to massive financial gains the city has seen since 2020. The same thing. Elimination of cultivation tax could spur unprecedented growth in this sector and provide a net benefit for all involved. These potential impacts merit an investigation and ask to look at. This is why I brought this item before us today. We need to do our due diligence on this topic for the consumers and business community. I also like to just point out that since we began collecting revenue in 2019, our city has brought in over $50 million over the past five years through cannabis, retail and revenues. We've also brought in an additional $8 million. I know we have a pending social equity program, which I want to reemphasize is a priority for me. And so I'm asking for, obviously, the Council to support this item this evening. I want to thank council members Pryce and Allen for their support on this item.

Speaker 4: The items being moved and seconded. Is there any member of the public that wish to address Council on Item 19? Please come forward. State your name. Speaker 6: Yes. My name is Patrick Brody of the American Patients Rights Association. I have a specific concern over the definition of controlled substances, because that may apply to medical marijuana within the city of Long Beach. Now, if that is the case, this action is not in compliance with federal or state law. I should bring it to your attention. The Department of Justice did recognize California's Proposition 215 last month, and that. Speaker 7: By Proposition. Speaker 6: 215, restricting the growing of medical marijuana within a person's domicile is illegal. The city may not prohibit that because that that is recognized by federal law and it is state law. So. Yes, thank you. Speaker 4: Thank you. Speaker 6: My name is David Zink. I live in the seventh district. Our city doesn't have a very good history. Speaker 7: Of dealing with this issue. I'm afraid it's sad. But at the July 17th Planning Commission meeting, our chief of. Speaker 6: Police stated that his men have. Speaker 7: Watched dispensaries and they determined that the people didn't look very sick going in and out of these places. That is the most absurd assertion I have ever heard him make, and it angers me. No doctor. Doctors? No doctor. Ah, but. But why would a bus load of doctors would not sit and try to diagnose people from afar? But this is the kind of leadership and example our department is getting. It's not right. As long as the unreasonable attitude of the prohibitionists that exist in our city government. Speaker 6: Continue. Speaker 7: Their unreasonableness. There will never be a reasonable resolution because we have a 48 page document produced by the City Attorney's Office that is the most atrocious thing. And after they looked at the task force that had put together some work look, looked at their work, they only had 41 pages. They added seven more pages. They thought of more ways to restrict and choke this. They're following the lead set by our former attorney general when he called them together after the police chiefs and the sheriffs to discuss how they could undermine, circumvent and otherwise scuttle this law. That's not the job of any police officer. They are not to make judgments about the law. And that's why I say our department is poorly led, poorly disciplined, poorly trained and out of control.

We've currently got security officers located at La Quinta, Ramada Inn, Western Motor in Hampton Inn, Quality Inn and Roadway in. Awesome. And what do we use as metrics of success for the security companies that we're using in these locations? I'll go ahead and kick that question on over to Cammy. Thank you. Thanks for the question. Caswell and CdeBaca. So we work in very close contact with our DHS and host partners, as well as the providers checking in with them verbally, really. And I wouldn't say it was a formal process, although we're certainly open to making that a more formal process. We weren't intending that this was going to be a long term engagement. However, since it is expanding to the end of January, we can certainly look at a more formalized process process. But for now it is a verbal discussion with them about the performance of the provider. We have quite a few discussions with them because there have been changes with the number of security professionals per shift and so that is constantly moving depending on the needs. So we're having that conversation on a frequent basis. So I asked this question because one of our other security contracts for 4 million, there was a murder on their watch. And so I'm wondering, when we talk about or when we hire security, how do we gauge their success and what are the consequences if they don't meet whatever that bar is? Sure. Absolutely. And so, again, I would say right now, it's it's not a formalized process, just verbal in nature, checking in with them, checking in with the provider, because they really are on each of these are at each of these site locations on an ongoing basis. And so they have a very close relationship with the security professionals that are there providing the service. So we really look to them to provide us that feedback. And each each location operates a little bit differently, and there could be different providers at each of the locations. So it really is about that one on one contact with them to ensure that they are delivering the services that we've agreed to. And what are those services? Sure. So the scope of work really is a a monitor and report, I would say or not monitor and report my my that it's a observe and report.

Those uses were essentially restaurants with alcohol, beverage service with meals, florists with accessory sale of alcohol, existing legal nonconforming uses in certain grocery stores if they were of a certain size. Since that time, we have done some research on what other cities have have in place for their issuance of conditional use permit exemptions and are suggesting that we come back to you tonight with a one change that would not allow us to provide any more exemptions for grocery stores of 20,000 square feet or more. That category seemed to provide the most room for interpretation, since there are a number of other retailers out there that may not be classically defined as a grocery store, but do carry grocery and HomeGoods components. So with that, we are suggesting that we still have the ability to continue to to issue conditional use permit exemptions for restaurant with alcohol beverage service related to meals that we would still issue them for florists that we would still issue them for legal nonconforming uses that may be in place, but that we not allow grocery stores to receive these exemptions.

The things that anyone said they are fighting to win material benefits, to live better and in peace, to see their lives go forward, to guarantee the future of their children. We have watched thousands of longtime residents leave Boston because of the rising cost of housing. Our neighbors, who have called Boston home for decades, cannot afford to purchase a home in their hometown and struggle to keep up with the rising costs of rent through the federal Section eight voucher program. We are able to subsidize rent and voucher holders are able to use their vouchers to purchase a home. In addition to expanding Section eight vouchers. We as a city can create our own voucher program. I'm a B, a little bit creative, and I came up with a name for it, but it's called the Boston Priority Housing Voucher , where we have the. Speaker 0: Flexibility to define who. Speaker 3: Is eligible for the assistance and would be able to create equity applicants like we have done in other programs. This is an opportunity to bring much needed housing assistance to long term Boston residents who are stuck in the middle. I've come across many of our neighbors who make too much to qualify for housing assistance but do not earn enough to purchase a home by layering relief. We will provide our neighbors with a clear path to the middle class as interest rates go up. Borrowing requirements will become more strict to increase homebuyers buying power. It would take more than just down payment assistance. If we are serious about homeownership, let's put Bostonians in the best positions to purchase and make Boston their permanent home and to continue on with Councilor Baker's analogy. Imagine, imagine going to Vegas, rolling the dice, being able to buy everyone in the city of Boston the home. Thank you. Speaker 0: Thank you, counselor. All the chair recognizes counsel. Clarity.

We have watched thousands of longtime residents leave Boston because of the rising cost of housing . We will provide our neighbors with a clear path to the middle class as interest rates go up .  Boston's rental and homeownership markets are extremely competitive and are among the most expensive in the United States . The cost of living in Boston has increased steeply over the last decade .
