Speaker 5: As of as of last week. Speaker 0: And I feel that in although there's been some concern about the the resolution becoming weakened after our weeks worth of deliberations, I think in many ways it's actually been strengthened because we have really, I think, honed in on why it is appropriate for the Seattle City Council to weigh in on this and and and the impact of these international actions on residents of our city, the impact of actions that are happening at the border on residents of our city. And so rather than just simply being a resolution against certain international actions, we are really focusing on our values as a city of being an inclusive, welcoming city and pointing to, I think, a lot of the strength of this community, while I hope preserving the intent of the language in the resolution to also be a strong antiwar statement. Speaker 4: Thank you. Council President Pro Tem Herbold I It was my original intention to have this resolution in opposing Trump's escalation to toward war in Iran last week.

Hello, Mayor and City Council. My name is Jordan. Shame on you. Your behavior is beyond unacceptable. Not only is the institution of policing fundamentally racist, but our BPD is a prime example. In addition, our police department honors and rewards officers involved in wrongful death and excessive force cases. Public records demonstrate that BPD showers, high pay, promotions and awards on its most violent and aggressive members. And in May, Long Beach City attorney Charles Parkin reported that the city has spent more than $31 million since 2014 to settle 61 excessive force and wrongful death claim lawsuits. Reimagining safety is about upending the imbalance of power and holding accountable those officers who act violently with impunity. This is all covered in the recent fourth article about the amount of money that is given out every year or over the past several years in these settlements. I have to ask, what do you expect to change if you're still giving this department a slush fund to cover all their murders? Why would they ever stop killing people if it's all covered and you get promoted if you kill or hurt someone? How does that disincentivize officers from reproducing this harm? Defund the police and take a bold stand against police violence, divest from BPD and invest differently in our community. Health and safety. Thank you. That concludes public comment for this item. Speaker 0: Again, it's want to make sure for future public comment. And Madam Clerk, also, we have to make sure that public item on the public comment is to the item specific we please.

Our mission to make renewable energy technology and job training accessible to underserved communities and a successful transition to clean energy. Here's some of the the results over the past. Since 2007, we've installed over 1450 solar systems in L.A., Orange and Ventura Counties. We've installed over 200 solar systems here in Long Beach. We've helped families save over $40 million in lifetime electricity costs. We've prevented the release of 99,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions here in our city. And we've provided over 5000 community members with solar installation experience and connections to future green career opportunities. And in fact, 87 of our volunteers last year, we connected to renewable energy jobs, which is pretty amazing, if you think about it, 87 jobs. So we're really proud of that.

As in previous years, there are many elements of this supplemental budget that I have no objection to, but there are some aspects that are very objectionable, and for that reason I will be voting no. This supplemental budget increases the police budget for this year 2021, by a total of $6 million. 333,540. How can the police complain of hundreds and hundreds of vacancies and a reduced payroll on the one hand and demand millions more dollars in mad money? On the other, it makes no sense. Some of that increased funding comes from the general fund and would better be spent on housing renewal programs and social services. Other funding comes from federal grants, and some of those grants are particularly ominous because it includes grants from the FBI and from Homeland Security for those so-called joint operations that have been used in the past to criminalize dissent. Like the way peaceful Black Lives Matter protesters were arrested and investigated by federal officers in the Justice for George Floyd movement last year.

And so that that overall that there is kind of a no net new net no net loss of wetlands along the in the coastal areas and in California. And in order to allow that, what has sprung up is essentially the ability to essentially it's created a market for areas where you can mitigate wetlands. And there are essentially developers that have been able to create wetlands mitigation. Banks were able to essentially purchase the right to impact wetlands in one location by mitigating, creating and enhancing or improving a wetland in another location. And there are all kinds of very detailed rules about how this occurs and a regulatory process that governs that. So usually what happens is a property owner. So for instance, the city of Alameda, property owner of land out at Alameda Point could essentially partner with a wetlands mitigation developer and create a bank on its property to essentially receive mitigation credits from developers throughout the Bay Area that are impacting coastal wetlands. And essentially they get paid to do that. And essentially what it does is from the proceeds of that, that banking you're able to create open space and wetlands on land. And so we did based on a referral from Councilmember Ody, we did evaluate this as a possibility at Alameda Point. So as a really as a means of creating open space and paid for through a funding source. So money that is, you know, not coming from the general fund, not coming from the base reuse department. But it also has a benefit of creating not only the the potential money for the creation of open space, but the maintenance cost. There's an endowment that's part of it that creates essentially has to spin off sufficient funds to essentially maintain those wetlands. And so definitely something that we've been talking about thinking about for a long time and a point and and and really needed to delve into the details to understand whether or not we thought it was feasible . And so that is what we did. We consulted with our kind of our environmental consultant with a wetlands mitigation bank developer, was consultants that specialize in helping to create these with legal counsel on some of the issues related to state lands. Really try to delve in and do an analysis as to how feasible is this at Alameda Point. So there were two locations that are essentially zoned open space in our zoning that we looked at. One is deep paved park down here on the western edge of the seaplane lagoon. The other is this Northwest Territories, and I'll explain why these are different colors. But you can see in the black outline about 170 acres, I believe, or 170 acres",

The other is that they don't let you count public access as part of the wetlands mitigation, because the whole point is that this is essentially mitigating passive, very passive wetlands that exist today . And so you can't count the part that is that that creates that that that's still water .  State Lands Commission typically does not like to put permanent restrictions on their land . The value that could come from this would be probably about when you pay the developer because they would essentially be taking all the risk . We estimate in about $9 million after all of those reductions are made that could be netted from this .  There are typically pretty significant funds from the state to fund open space and parks . There are about six and half million dollars in WW funds for the East Bay Regional Park District has for a park at Alameda Point . And so there, you know, staff believes there are other ways .

Beyond disseminating the city's sales tax revenue. Our agency fully supports this code amendment and has absolute confidence in DPS ability to continue its trusted partnership with the city while expanding its role in the overall early childhood landscape through contracts with the state and other entities. OCA and Denver Preschool Program have over a 15 year history of partnering together to bring affordable, high quality preschool to Denver children and families. Since deep inception, the city has modeled multiple special revenue funds around. Deep and deep has evolved to meet the needs of the city and its residents. DPP is well positioned to serve as the local lead for the state's universal pre-K program and OCA fully supports DPP stepping into this role. The implementation of universal pre-K in Denver will benefit from CBP's expertize and understanding of how to get funds to families and providers and DBP will even be better equipped to support the development of an early childhood ecosystem that can serve more families.

So as you know, it's been getting pretty chilly in the mornings. This morning I was out and there were a lot of people wrapped up in coats, hats, gloves and a lot of blankets. And so we're really, you know, we're really excited that we have found the winter shelter opportunity so that the folks who are on the streets will have an opportunity to keep warm. While it may seem that this is sort of a last minute find, I want you to know that we've been searching everywhere that we could possibly look for the last three months, looking throughout the city of Long Beach as well as in neighboring jurisdictions. We had worked with the realtor, the Economic and property management team. LAS We've reached out to our faith based organizations. Everyone we could to identify this site as our previous Atlantic Farm site was not available this year, and the only one that met criteria and that was available was the city in the Old North Library. We're so thankful the building is available. The site being discussed today will be used for the winter shelter this year only it will not be used in the future. As a winter shelter site, the city of Long Beach is releasing an RFP for another use of that building. So it is a short term, less than four month opportunity to be able to house folks who are currently on the street.

And there is credit given and funds applied to it. And as we look at all of these, there is different things that we need to think about.

We have some large hydro, which California doesn't recognize, but it also reduces carbon. So when we look at that, we were able to take. Under the cap and trade regulations. There were so many recs that were allotted to us and we were able to use some of those and sell them to others for use for them to come up to their incremental allotments that they had to come up to. So we took advantage of the fact that previous boards were very smart. We had nearly 80% renewable. Of that, we were close to 60% and which was California eligible. So our board determined that we would not go under 40%, that we would. In some way create a commodity out of what we had in the. Space in between. And so we were able to sell that to others. One was water district bought from us so that they could be compliant.

We live in a new world with our new administration. We must take advantage of every opportunity to celebrate our diversity. Thank you to everyone who continues to serve on our community, in this community on a daily basis. From the LGBTQ center of Long Beach, who provides social services like crisis counseling, HIV, AIDS, test and attend meetings for people of all ages to the AIDS Food Store. For the past 30 plus years have been distributing food to people living with HIV AIDS who might not otherwise be able to obtain food to the Imperial Court. And yes, I do actually we do have a crown as well, but I didn't bring it tonight. And who dedicates their free time to raising money for other LGBTQ communities to ensure they are able to continue to operate? To Long Beach Pride, who we also have a presentation for Produce of the second largest event in Long Beach. But it is committed to serve the community 365 days out of the year through scholarships to youth and low income housing for seniors and many others and newer organizations like we've seen just recently, like Project Alpha, founded by two new, which helps the LGBTQ AAPI community and does tremendous work in that scope.

Suicide is currently the 10th leading cause of death for adults. And when you go to the ages of 10 to 34 years old, it is actually the second leading cause of death, which is heartbreaking. As somebody myself who is struggling with suicidal ideation, as some members of this council shared their own struggles. We know that part of the problem is that mental health and concerns around mental health are stigmatized in a way that prevent people from seeking help and doing that. And so while I have the floor and if anybody is watching this, you can seek confidential emotional support by calling the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 28, which is 24 seven at one 800 273 talk and four for English. And it's actually 18818886289454 for Spanish. This is something that I'd like to. With with this pandemic, we're going to see sort of unseen levels of post traumatic stress disorder, unseen levels of trauma. And I don't think that we have adequately we didn't have the resources, frankly, on the ground to deal with trauma and things like that the way we needed to before this pandemic. And I think this is something that beyond just resolutions and things that we're going to do as we head into this next step of recovery, this is something that simply does just have to be a focus for us and for our city and for the country. And so I'd also like to thank my co-sponsor on this councilman here who has bravely shared her story time and time again. And so I hope to see real assets and real attention on this matter moving forward, because mental health is wildly important to the city and really is wildly important to everything else that anybody does on any given day.

I'm sorry. I'm not speaking. I passed it. So this hearing water really is about getting that right, you know, every day. You know, too often in the city of Boston, we have our residents who are displaced because of fire. You know, one of my early cases as an attorney was helping a family navigate the experience of losing their home to a fire and really working with the city departments to get that client shelter. Really taught me a lot. But not just shelter, access to resources, making sure that they were close enough to the hospital that one of our children went to so that he could receive dialysis. There was so much involved in once a family is displaced from a fire, oftentimes landlords that are required to maintain insurance don't do that. And they're supposed to be able to provide relocation benefits to their tenants. But that doesn't always happen. And so this hearing order is about figuring out how we get it right. How do we show up for our vulnerable residents who face fires, you know, analyze Boston's fire incident reporting system? Does it have any quantifiable, quantifiable data on the injuries or displacement numbers? And we know the city of Boston has an emergency assistance fund for victims of fire, that we need to do more work to make sure that we're supporting all of our residents. There were recently there's recently a fire in Mattapan, and there were young leaders from the Mattapan teen center that held a bake sale because we were falling short as a city in providing for this family. There have been multiple occasions where families who had nowhere to go showed up in our office. Shout out to my chief of staff, Emily, who is, you know, does a great job at triaging that issues.

Mayor Garcia, members of the City Council decided relates to the renovation and continued operation of the Worthington Ford Sign, located on city owned land, leased to Worthington Ford within the Freeway Roundabout at Lakewood Boulevard in the four or five freeway. The lease premises is 3.24 acres, accessible only through an off ramp. Underpass, is not a developable site and can only be used for storage purposes. Since 1996, Worthington Ford has leased the premises for temporary storage of vehicles and for the construction and maintenance of a freeway adjacent electronic display sign. The city leases the premises to Worthington Ford at a rate that is fully offset by the cost of maintenance and trash and debris removal. Worthington seeks to renovate the freeway sign to provide high resolution graphics. The city also controls 20% of the advertising time on the sign for public service announcements. Without such renovation, the freeway sign will become outdated, which may result in diminished sales volumes and diminished value of the city's 20% advertising time. The cost of renovation is approximately $680,000. Worthington requests that the city participate in 50% of the cost of renovation through a sales tax sharing agreement. The proposed agreement shall be for a term of 15 years or upon reimbursement of $340,000 in sales tax revenue above a base of $380,000, whichever first occurs.",

And so I appreciate him asking me to come back this week to give a little presentation on what this item is that you see each quarter and that the new council members will see on the council agenda every quarter. And it's an often it's an unimportant audit that our office does and oversees on a quarterly basis. And if the if I could have the next slide, please. So our office oversees the performance audit of the cash and investment balances of the city of Long Beach. And as of May 31st, this particular quarter, the city's cash and investments portfolio totaled approximately $2.1 billion. And we perform these audits. They're all conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Next slide. And as I mentioned, the city charter requires the office of the City Auditor to verify the cash and investment balances every quarter in the city Treasurer's office and provide a written report to the City Council. Next slide. The purpose of the audit is the audit and cash investment balances of the city of Long Beach include verifying cash and investments with the outside depositories and evaluating the City Treasurer's compliance with the California Government Code and the city investment policy, which is adopted by the City Council. Next slide. There are pooled cash and investments and the city's pooled cash. It's a grouping of the city's available cash for investments. And this larger amount of money involved allows the city to earn a higher rate of return than if each fund were by itself. These pooled funds are not needed for operations and are invested by the Treasury Bureau. Thus, the interest income earned from the pooled cash investments is apportioned to the funds based on the ratio of daily cash balances to the total of pooled cash and investments. Next slide. The audit objectives are to reconcile cash and investments to the amount and description recorded on the city's books with the outside depositories, and to evaluate the city's compliance with the provisions in the California Government Code and the city's investment policy.

Councilmember Morales, I understand you are the sponsor of the bill, so you are recognized in order to address this item. Speaker 4: Thank you. Yes. So Council Bill 119859 would delay for one year, as I mentioned this morning. The effective date of the heating oil tax that was adopted in 2019. As I said, the intent of the original ordinance was to tax heating oil in an effort to accelerate the rate of conversion from oil heat to electric heat pump systems. In response to community feedback about the impacts of this tax on low income and middle income households, particularly during COVID, O.C. is proposing, we delay implementation for one year. And just to give you an example of why this could be cost prohibitive for many families, we know that the average cost to convert oil to electric heat and decommission an oil tank is about $13,000 per tank. And that doesn't include the costs for clean up if those tanks have leaked under somebody's home. So that can run 40, $50,000. So this is really especially when some of these homes that have oil heating are very old and there's a high likelihood that these tanks could potentially leak or be damaged in transition. It's important that we take a pause on implementing this tax so that we set up systems to be able to support families better. The is the memo that you all received indicated we are also looking at some possible changes to the Pollution Liability Insurance Agency. I'll talk about that in a moment with the amendment. But we do want to make sure that families are getting all the assistance they can with loans or grants to be able to afford the cost of making the switch.

So is there a way we can reach back out to scouting troops? And I know this is a private contractor, but there's a lot of interest out there in youth about getting involved.

We also have a lot of work to do when it comes to our beach, lots and lots at our at our parks. And also looking at looking at ways that we can actually look at our current building code and increase the current three, the current 3% percentage. There's been a lot of also question about the fees. I hope the commission can also look at that and what we're actually both charging and being charged by our partners. And so this is just really an opportunity for the commission to come back to us and to strengthen our current policy as it's laid out. And I think it's time considering that our our actual vehicle drivers are growing. In fact, there are a few on this council. The infrastructure needs to be, quite frankly, dramatically improved across the city and across the county. And it's time for us to take take the lead on that. And so if I can have your your support and we'll hear some great, I think, recommendations over the course of the next few months. With that, there's a motion by Vice Mayor Lowenthal and Councilmember Austin. I'm gonna turn this over to Vice Mayor Lowenthal. Speaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

First Edition The committee recommends the petition be granted as conditioned. Speaker 0: Because member Brian. Speaker 5: Thank you. So this alley vacation is on the block. We talked about this a little bit, but the block where town hall is on first hill, the project would vacate the alley to allow for construction of a single underground parking structure that will serve two new towers that are going in on the I guess that would be the southeastern half of the block. And then the alley will be restored. It will no longer be public right away, but there will be passage through there. The public benefit includes a number of benefits, the most prominent of which is public plaza, which will be on the immediately to the southwest of town hall. And I've been a skeptic in the past of public causes as public benefit for street only vacations. But I really want to applaud the applicants on this for what I consider to be really excellent work with the community, including with Town Hall as an entity to design a public plaza that really enhances the public benefits for accessing the town hall. And even for folks that aren't using town halls, it fronts on two adjacent streets. I think this is a good example of a strong set of public benefits worthy of our support for this alley vacation.

I agree with you about the public benefit here, but I, I strongly encourage our friends at town hall to consider limiting access. You know, we've set up this wonderful public plaza that's going to be separated from an access point to the town hall, which which will have some bollards to keep folks from the plaza walking into what is going to be a very lightly used space for kind of pick up and drop off. And I would love for us to think about what some street treatments would look like to allow for that to be more of a public space during the times when people won't be at events, the town hall and more of a drop off from times when there are events. I know that's not something we can really condition, but I'm hopeful that our friends at Town Hall and the friends of Lennar will consider that as an alternative so that we can keep more of the space for people more times of the day.

But you're absolutely right. Services have been interrupted. Interrupted. We have many programs that are operating under the strenuous conditions. We have some programs that operate in in-person learning, some that operate a hybrid model, which is a combination of in-person and virtual learning. Some are doing 100% at home learning, and so it varies across the seven delegate agencies that we fund. But funding has not been interrupted at all. We have a bill that another set of amendments that will be coming through that will be awarding Head Start COVID funding, which will support some summer operations that were funded just a few months ago, that took place a few months ago, when most as our programs are not open, they were allowed to request funds to open under COVID, and we gave them that permission and now we're going to give them the money that was associated with opening. So it varies really across the agencies that we fund. We also have vendors that are providing services, whether in health, mental health.

I would like I see Rob Ness, Nisga'a and Kirsten Crawford on the line, and I would love for them to explain to council members and the public what council members options are tonight for votes, considering this is a contract that was arbitrated. So if that's possible, Kirsten, can you can you let us know? But evening council members in the Senate may be up here and they're all. Well, yes, that's a good question. And a few of you have asked us as well. So there are a number of reasons that this agreement needs to be memorialized in writing. Beyond just the award that the arbiter has rendered, but starting in no particular order under Section 9814 of the charter, both the terms agreed to by the parties and the decision awarded by the arbiter require a written agreement. It's explicitly laid out in the charter, but there's other really important reasons. The the parties, as you know, are bound by the arbiters decision. It is binding arbitration. So both parties are bound to abide by what the arbiter has decided, but also beyond that can choose voluntarily if they mutually agreed to deviate from the decision. So in order of determining finality of the parties decisions as to whether they accept the arbiters award or choose to continue to negotiate for reasons of finality, the agreement needs to be put in writing. There's other reasons, too. They're just highlighting. One of the most important articles in the agreement that is beyond the scope of the Arbiter Award is Article five, which contains a provision where the city does not mandate any more fair share fees be extracted from the officer's paycheck. That's based on a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision. And so Article five says we will take the dues if an officer agrees that they would want us to do so in writing. You know, some of the other reasons is projected liabilities need to be encumbered and the only way to recover is through a written agreement. In other words, the contract. And in this particular situation, counsel is the one who has to determine whether a contract is approved here. So that's clearly counsel authority. There's other just charter interpretation reasons, but those are the most important reasons. And thank you for the question because I have had others ask us as well. And so let me summarize and tell me if I am capturing this. So a vote tonight is not symbolic. And in fact, our vote tonight, it constitutes our agreement or disagreement with the arbitrator, which is required. Correct. No, that's not correct. The the arbitration decision is being analyzed. So it's not a discretionary decision. So my question here. So my question here is, given that we do have yes, no or abstain options",

John Griffin and Roberts were better suited to talk about the process because they were intimately hands on involved at every step of the way .

As you know, our youth is very important to us, and this program has one of those benefits that we always look for in a community program. It's been a great partnership that the city has had with Longmont Unified School District in regards to its Junior Lifeguard program and especially the program as it has grown in the last couple of years. It has grown to the extent that many of the kids that are being recruited and who participate in the program come from our most communities and need our disenfranchizes and are just going to the communities in West Langley and Moorestown as well. So many of the kids come from Cabrillo High School, which is in my district and Silverado Park, and understand that there's also a bus goes around. It picks up kids from other schools who are interested in participating in junior lifeguards, specifically during high school walk in the water. So I want to thank the school district for its partnership with the city of Long Beach and working together and getting this program going. It's a great opportunity for kids to learn about lifesaving. It provides an opportunity for them to look at a career path that will eventually lead not only to a great paying job as a as a lifeguard, but to other life, other great benefits that it has for people as you grow up and become a community members. So with that, I want to thank the city and leadership for working together. I hope that this program continues to grow.

Your Urunga recommendation to proceed with the restorations.

Speaker 4: I turn this over to Vice Mayor Richardson. Speaker 0: Thank you, Mayor Garcia. Public safety is a core responsibility of our city. Without a safe city, our families, communities and neighborhoods cannot thrive, expand and prosper. As a Lumbee City Council member, I am committed to our city's public safety needs. Our entire city council has demonstrated that and will always seek ways to improve our service delivery to our residents. I was honored to support restorations in East Long Beach and with Engine eight and reestablish the South Division. But today is particularly special for me because of the history and significance of what today's recommendation means not only the North Long Beach, but the entire city. It's not a new conversation. It's been almost seven, seven year campaign. It was the first budget that my predecessor, Councilman Steve Neal, worked on in 2010 when Rescue 12 was eliminated due to dire budget circumstances. I was there as chief of staff and we were forced to have a very uncomfortable conversation with our community expanding, explaining that we were losing a very important asset and that response times would certainly be affected. Since then, we faced increased response times across the city and the safety of our residents has been has been significantly compromised . For example, we know that in 2005, our average response time for all emergency services was 5 minutes and 29 seconds. But in 2015, the average spot's time was 6 minutes and 16 seconds. In 2015, after the county, Los Angeles, eliminated the Rapid Medic Deployment Model Pilot Program, we lost the R&D Basic Life Support Rescue in District nine , and our office launched the Save Our Services campaign with the community to talk about restoring that paramedic service. We came back to City Council and asked staff to find answers to restore the service utility utilizing GMT funding. And first response was a first responder fee and it was determined then that the resources were not yet in place to restore paramedic service to District nine. Then on November 22nd, 2016, after the voters adopted Measure A and a number of additional revenue measures, I made a motion asking staff to create a plan to restore Rescue 12 and additional services in the first quarter of 2017. Once we saw a complete revenue picture and in processing of the results of the November election on February 1st, City Manager West responded to the Council by submitting a fiscal, fiscally prudent and responsible plan to restore Paramedic Rescue 12, as well as the reinstatement of police academy operations allowing for faster",

Refunding bonds to refund bonds of the former Community Improvement Commission of the City of Alameda in approving related documents and actions. Speaker 0: Thank you. I. Do we have a presentation? Yes. Otter. Speaker 1: Good evening. I'm Debbie Potter, the city's community development director. Tonight, staff is requesting that the successor agency authorize the issuance and sale of tax allocation refunding bonds of the former Community Improvement Commission. These bonds will refund tax allocation bonds that were sold in May of 2011, just prior to the dissolution of redevelopment agencies. The original bonds were sold to raise funds necessary to acquire the Island Motel and convert the former motel into permanent affordable housing, now known as Park Alameda. The bonds were sold in a high in a high interest rate environment due to the uncertain climate around redevelopment. State legislation governing former redevelopment agencies has strict requirements about when you can issue new bonds. New bonds can only be issued if there is a savings to the taxing entities over the life of the bonds due to the original bonds high interest rate. There will be substantial savings to the taxing entities over the next 24 years, ranging from 4.1 to $4.6 million. Annual savings could range from 165 to $200000, depending on final bond pricing. The city is a taxing entity and would realize an annual savings of 50 to $60000. This savings would come as additional redevelopment property tax trust fund moneys to the general fund. If the successor agency authorizes the issuance and sale of the bonds, staff will then seek approval from the oversight board. Following Oversight Board approval, we will then submit the request to issue bonds to the State Department of Finance. Once we have secured the office, approval, staff will prepare the official statement and other documents required for the sale of the bonds. The official statement and related documents will be presented to the successor agency prior to the issuing of the bonds. Tonight's action authorizes staff to begin the process of issuing and selling refunding bonds to provide savings to the taxing entities over the life of the bonds. I, as well as our team, is available this evening if there are any questions. That concludes my staff report. Speaker 0: Thank you. Any questions? Answer.

And so I just want to thank Chris. I think you're still here in the audience for for sitting down and walking me through the map and the cost sharing. And I have no further questions on this. There is just one related to at some point asking council to have project updates on where we're at in the scope of the project. How far along are they and where are we with funding? Have we added new dollars? Have we used only the dollars that were built within those projects on plot to Park Hill and on the National Western Center? I think having those periodic updates to council is going to be important to just track how we're doing with them Speaker 1: . All right. Thank you, Councilman Ortega. That concludes the items we called out this evening. All bills are for introduction, are ordered published. We're now ready for the block vote on resolutions and bills on final consideration.

And all of our tenant protection ordinances are there along with implementing regulations. And this ordinance has an implementing regulation that we will be updating that that further talks about how how this is all being handled. I do not believe that we have put up anything in any other languages to date. We also the paralegal in the attorney's office is fielding questions about the about the rent freeze and the moratorium. So we are providing information as well as the rent program is and central legal who we are contracting with also has copies of our ordinance and our implementing regs. Speaker 0: Okay.

So the staff report and you mentioned stakeholder outreach. Do we have any information about locally how many people are deferring their rent, etc.? Like what the impact is? Speaker 3: So I did have an opportunity on the 10th of July to to meet with Eastbay, the East Bay Realtors, Base Realtors, their local government relations committee. And it sounds like. People are feeling pretty good. They were saying maybe some of the folks who do property management were saying maybe 70, 75% of their tenants have been paying rent in full. And it sounds like there are tenants who have been availing themselves of different assistance that is out there. Our rent relief program is hopefully launching this week. So the program that the council approved last month, we hope to launch this week, so that that will also be promoted as a part of really at least providing an asset and a resource for folks to apply for assistance. So my sense is that landlords are concerned because the longer this is lasting, the kind of scarier and the harder it is. But it it kind of feels like. More than a majority of tenants are paying rent. And and those that are those that maybe have some challenges are getting some assistance, I guess is kind of what I heard. Speaker 0: But I swear.

Speaker 0: Give us a motion the second there's there's one member of the public wants to speak also Councilmember Pierce. Speaker 4: Okay. Yeah. I'd like to talk a little bit about this. I know John is cued up. We're really excited. It's $10,000, so I do. That's a lot of money coming from my divide by nine. So I do want to take a moment because I think that all of the council members will probably want to do this in their district. So Elevate LBE Business Academy is a pilot program in the second District that will give retail establishments the opportunity to stay competitive and profitable. While understanding different challenge of the media distribution. It also allows for some insight for brick and mortar as long as as well as online sales, along with funding expansion among many other areas. So really, we know that in the second district we have Fourth Street and we have Broadway. And often we talk about supporting our small businesses. We've had a number of unfortunately, of small businesses leave for Street in the last several years, mainly because of issues like their rent increases or access to capital. And so our staff is working on access to capital issues. We're working on some other issues around speculation. But one of the biggest things is making sure that our small businesses that really are people that really work seven days a week in their shops have all the tools and resources that they need to be able to succeed and expand their business. So I'd like to turn it over to staff to talk a little bit about it, and then I'd love to hear from the public. Thank you. Speaker 10: Honorable mayor and members of the city council. Thank you so much. A few months back, you recall that we received a report from Cal State Long Beach about some of the perceptions and confidence from their Small Business Monitor survey. And one of the challenges that the small businesses said that they faced in the coming year was challenges related to finding customers and retaining customers, particularly in this new environment with online, retail and other competing factors. And so in conversations with Cal State, Long Beach, as well as our Small Business Development Center at Long Beach City College , we were able to find some really good resources and package them as part of this Elevate Long Beach Business Academy. So this will be a pilot, of course. All of the funds associated with the city council district whose contribution here will actually go into the businesses. They will receive many grants to help",

This includes receiving donations of devices in mobile Internet hotspots and then wiping them using nationally certified processes. So they work with hospital systems and others who have very secure information that needs to be wiped in a very secure facility. Then that technology is refurbished and given back to those who might not have computer access otherwise. They have worked with the city and county of Denver in the past, but we have a very strong provision in our charter that requires any donations of equipment to be done by ordinance of the Council. And so it is made donations a little more unwieldy. I am here today with this bill. It doesn't use the word COVID 19 in it, but make no mistake that this was expedited in order to get more computers into the hands of families with kids who are going to try to be schooled through remote schooling to seniors who might need to have medical consultations with doctors via video rather than going in person to reduce their risk. And I want to thank first and foremost technology services, who has identified 100 computers that we would have had to pay to recycle if we couldn't do this. Donations. We're actually saving the city money by not paying a recycler and instead getting them into the hands of folks we need.

It is, as the city manager mentioned earlier, it isn't an easy thing to schedule. And so to have that already on the calendar perfect with our timing, we've kind of jumped on it, got things done. And so we hope that you're okay with us, going to them first, talking to them about it, kind of giving it almost like a dry run presentation of what, you know, some of our ideas and thoughts about how we address the referral and then come back to you on March 10th with those their comments, the same presentation, maybe tweaked a little bit based on some of their comments and a staff report kind of outlining our approach to the referral and how we think the city should proceed. Also, just another thing to note is that at that particular meeting we find ourselves with staff and I know it comes up in the public conversation as well as when we start talking about transportation, we end up talking about housing. And when we start talking on housing, we start talking about transportation. And there had been a direction by the Council on January six to look at the density bonus ordinance and to address some issues related to density bonus ordinance and then the larger development occurring in the Northern Waterfront housing element. And so we decided there will be two staff reports, but it will be kind of a workshop housing, a transportation workshop. They're such dense topics. We",

The proposal is to rezone from the existing planning and development number 96 to aumx3 zone district. This map shows the location of the proposed rezoning within the city, within Council District eight and within the Five Points neighborhood. This closing view shows the specific location of the property. It's located near the corner of Downing and 22nd Avenue. This would be the eastern edge of the San Rafael neighborhood within five points. And it's a block or two north of the current reconstruction project for exemplar Saint Joseph's Hospital expansion, which shows up pretty well in this aerial from 2012. The property. The current uses restaurant and lounge named Randalls. The property is a fifth of an acre in size. Current zoning is already mentioned as Pudi A96 and the request is to rezone to a you mix three zone district. First, a little bit of information about pad 96. This was created in 1983. The intent was to enable the renovation and expansion of Piers Supper Club, which is a long established use at the time that many of you may remember, the development standards, as was common of this era of planned unit developments, were specific to the proposed renovation of Piers. This means that the use that was proposed at the time is the only use that is allowed by the PWD. The only thing you can have in this building is a restaurant and lounge. Similarly, all of the development standards are also specific to how the building was constructed and renovated. Setbacks, building heights. Everything is exactly what you see on the ground. The request is to rezone to a standard zoned district urban neighborhood mixed use three stories max height the umx3 district.

Council, Royal and Council Genocide Order. Speaker 7: So last month, the Committee on Education held a hearing on Docket 0199 in order for a hearing on state receivership for Boston Public Schools. As you all may remember, I tried to pass this resolution on the floor, and I was encouraged by my colleagues that we needed a hearing and we did just that. The goal of the hearing was to educate the public and the council around what receivership is and how it impacts our school communities. The hearing was insightful because we heard time and time again from the administration advocates, family members, students and members of the community. That receivership is wrong is the wrong move for state receivership is wrong, is the wrong move for Boston for many reasons, not least of which is that D.C. has a miserable track record of improving schools it has taken into receivership. VSC has voted to place three districts in receivership. Lawrence in 2021. Holyoke in 2015, which I opposed back then as a parent advocate and Southbridge in 2016. Southbridge and Holyoke are now the worst performing and second worst performing school districts in the state. According to Ducey's most district ranking. Following an initial uptick, Lawrence has been on the decline, and it's now back on the lowest of 6% of districts. A Boston Globe analysis of test scores, graduation rates, college enrollment and a dozen other metrics Lawrence, Holyoke and Southbridge published on Sunday show that the state has failed to meet almost all of its stated goals for the district. BP's is not without its problems, and we all know that because we sit in these budget hearings every day. But these are problems that can be solved by turning to the community, not by initiating yet another executive leadership retooling. That kind of thinking lacks innovation and intentional. We avoid the core problems a BP is facing. You can swap out the players at the top all you want, but the instability created through that process trickles down to parents, students and teachers. And we're left exactly where we started. Only less engaged and less hopeful for the future. This resolution has been a long time coming. We filed it back in 2021, and there was a desire from the council to learn more about the receivership, which we did, which includes our school community. We followed through on that request and created space for community members and counselors to come forward and learn more.

Speaker 0: Thank you, Kasper Herbold. Speaker 2: Thank you so much. This bill addresses a technical issue from the 2017 Accountability Ordinance, which didn't address how complaints that named the chief of police should be addressed. I became aware of this issue earlier this year and immediately reached out to the mayor's office, the Inspector General and the Office of Police Accountability to chart a path forward to address this issue.

The legislation establishes a process for the intake, evaluation, classification and investigation of complaints that name the chief, either by a city unit or by an independent investigative body that is external to the city. That process would involve the Office of the Inspector General, and the legislation also requires key stakeholders in the person or people who made the complaint to be notified at investigative milestones. I'd like to thank Inspector General, Judge and interim okay Director Perkins, as well as their staffs for their assistance and time in developing this legislation. Central staff in my office held a number of meetings with them, and I worked through a number of complicated issues. I'd also like to thank the Community Police Commission, the Mayor's Office, for their collaboration on this legislation, as well as my own staff.

If passed, this legislation would amend the EPA's Enabling Act and remove public services corporations ability to seek an exemption to all Boston zoning laws by petitioning the State Department of Public Utilities. Instead, this legislation will give the Building Commissioner the authority to enforce environmental justice standards. If the Commissioner determines that a use or proposed use of a building structure or land in the city would negatively impact environmental rights afforded to residents by state law. The Building Commissioner would have the authority to issue a stop work order or suspend any issued permits, licenses or authorizations associated with the use or proposed use. At the working session, the committee heard from several environmental justice advocates about the urgency of securing environmental justice in Boston and protecting local communities. The utility company representatives stated that they believe that existing state regulations provided sufficient environmental justice protections. The sponsor clarified that the legislation would grant extra authority to the Building Commissioner and that more specific building standards can be crafted by the Zoning Commission and the Building Commissioner if the state passes this. There was a suggestion that language be added, specifying that the process of deciding those building standards shall be guided by the needs of a community through a civic engagement process.

We also want to make sure that any individual that or preventing another person from commenting by telling them to get out of their seat or any way intimidating them is also not acceptable according to our rules . We want to make sure that, again, another section that warnings can be given, but based on prior conduct as well, we can give a warning based on the prior conduct and by that we mean earlier in the week or just a pattern of behavior can be the basis for a warning. And then the other change is that we would like if if in fact, first of all, let me back up through the the formal rules allowed for the both the council president or the chair of the committee to give the warning or impose a sanction. This change allows any council member in any capacity participating in that meeting to be able to exercise that same authority. And then if in fact, the person wants to appeal, that they will do that at the next regularly scheduled full council meeting. Again, these have been approved by law and they think we think that it makes sense without offending anyone's right to free speech or constitutional speech and all of the liberties that we want to protect. I want to make a. An amendment to it just because we can do it at the committee. Describe what that amendment amendment is. It's basically the last part that I talked about, the appeal process being to the full council. Central staff pointed out that the prior rules allowed an appeal to the next committee. So there might have been an exclusion of the Parks Committee and the person appeals to the Transportation Committee. So we didn't think that made sense. We wanted to clean that up, and that's what the amendment is about. So first, I would like to move to amend Resolution 31659, which is the resolution just read Section 1d6 by substituting subsection six with a proposed language",

The MAP Amendment is located in Council District five in the Washington, Virginia Vail neighborhood. It is located on along Lee's Dale Drive between Forest Street and Hudson Street on the North Side. It's approximately five acres and it's currently developed with two retail buildings and undeveloped land. As I mentioned, this is a rezoning from former Chapter 59 custom zoned districts to the SCC three district, and this is requested to facilitate redevelopment of the site with mixed uses. The requested zone district is in the urban edged neighborhood context. It is a commercial corridor that would allow up to three stories or 45 feet. This district allows for a mix of uses that's intended to balance the need for pedestrian, skilled, diverse areas with need needs for a convenient automobile access. It allows the general drive thru services and drive thru restaurant forms. The subject site shown here is currently zoned within former Chapter 59 and I'll go through the details of those. The surrounding properties are generally single unit to the north and then a mix of districts, commercial districts, residential districts and other custom districts along Leeds. Dell Drive the Putty, which is a large portion of the proposed parcel, was established in 2009. This was an update from a previous PD and a portion of the site is also zoned as B3, which is a commercial district in former Chapter 59 with waivers and conditions, and that dates back to 1998. Both districts generally allow commercial uses, but they specifically prohibit residential. They include setback requirements, use limitations, requirements for buffering and screening, and also a maximum heights in elevation. There is a large grade change that happens on the site from leads due to the north. There are portions of the PD that are not included in this application and they would remain empty. 627 Going forward. As I mentioned, the subject property is currently developed with retail and there is some undeveloped land there, single unit residential generally to the north and then a mix of retail office and residential",

So I just wanted a little more information about this. What? So this is a steady hello, Ms.. Adair, who's our finance director? Um, uh, this is a study looking into. Well, you can probably tell us that we're capturing all of the property tax. We should, because it's the largest source of the general fund. Is that that correct? Speaker 1: So, hello, council members. Madame Mayor Allen, our dear finance director. This particular contract actually provides us with so hd all corn and corn. And what they provide is they assist us with projections of the property taxes. They review the taxes that are assessed by the county in making sure that the city receives its fair share, whether it's for specific properties or things such as equipment and things like that, that is not necessarily secured by, let's say, a single family home. So they look into those and make sure it does come to the city if it's within the city. City limits, if you wish. They also provide us with on the annual basis with a report that breaks down things like general fund related properties and revenues, as well as what used to be a redevelopment agency, currently a successor agency, do still provide us all the information that relates to it. It assists us to also figure out how much money is going to come in in order to pay successor agency obligations. They provide updates. They also provide us with things like This is what we expect next year's assessments will be or what they expect. The CPI increase would be, so they assist cities with that information as well. So it's a variety of services. One of the things that they do is they do sometimes audits. And actually, I guess I would say fortunately for Alameda, within the prior period that they were under the contract, we only had twice that they actually had to go in and do certain corrections. So usually it happens at extra charge outside of regular agreements, but we've only got it twice and the dollar amounts were very minimal. Speaker 2: So when you say corrections, does that mean that we. And too much tax. Speaker 1: Usually that we didn't get enough or somebody was paying it to another entity, let's say outside of city of Alameda. Let's say it would have may have been Oakland.

I had requested some information from public works, which I received and I am now going through. As you know, I have continued to ask a lot of questions about. Looking at how we determine. You know who gets these contracts? Which ones get renewed and have funding added to? We don't see on the front end how many of them will have an BWB goals attached to them. And I think this is our process of us being able to approve all of these contracts, and I think we need to look at shoring that up more so so that when we want to look back and see what the impact is that we have had from uncle contracts, making sure that as folks in our in BWB community have have shared concerns in the past, that sometimes they think this might be a way of circumventing the BWB process and without always being able to get the data on how many have we used, how often have we used them, how many did we never use at all? And it's expensive to go through responding to an RFP and then finally getting one and then maybe never even being utilized. And so until we see the data, we don't know what all of that is and what that shows.

But what I would like to do is anticipation for that meeting is I'd like the city attorney to provide us with a report on the proposed initiative and the items that have been enumerated in the proposed initiative that are different than what we have discussed previously at council in regards to things such as land use, cups, buffers, taxes. I'd like to just get a sense of what the differences are in the proposed initiative so that we can discuss that and talk about it. The other thing I would like the city attorney to do is to provide council with an overview of recreational marijuana and the interplay between recreational marijuana and medical marijuana. Educating us a little bit on what would happen if recreational passed, what would that do to medical? What would happen if both passed? How would they interplay with one another in terms of our land use options? And so I think those will be great discussion points. And as I indicated to my cosigners in regards to a competitive ballot initiative and thinking about one, I think it's important for us to have some data. The initiative that's on there is really the last place that we were as a council, and that's why it's offered.

Whereas Dr. Charles Brannigan has recently announced that he is retiring as the chair of the Uptown Health Care District Design Forum after more than 27 years of volunteer service, of working tirelessly and selflessly on behalf of residents, businesses and health care institutions of the Uptown Neighborhood. And.

Under Dr. Branigan's leadership for 27 years, the forum has fostered friendly communications between registered neighborhood organizations and health care organizations. In Uptown worked with Denver Planning Office to develop an Uptown Health Care Design District and helped shape the expansion of the Presbyterian St Luke's Hospital, the redevelopment of the former St Luke's Hospital into a mixed use area, the acquisition of the Saint Joseph's Hospital and the Children's Hospital campus, and the construction of the new Saint Joseph's Hospital. He's met with many developers to comment on the improve various new projects in the neighborhood and and fought crime and other problems within the neighborhood.

So last year's budget process, city council allocated an additional $300,000 in structural funding towards the Long Beach Justice Fund. The item before you item number three is to approve contracts for the legal services provider and community connectors to support the continued operation of the Long Beach. Just fine. So we're going to continue to utilize immigrant defenders, also known as MDA as our legal services provider. They're responsible for providing direct representation for individuals who live and work in Long Beach and are facing removal or deportation. The legal services provider provider will adhere to the universal representation model by which representation is offered to as many clients as funding will be allowed without qualifying based on the merits of the case. In response to the challenges posed by COVID 19 for fiscal year 21, the Long Beach Justice Fund Oversight Committee recommended adding a community connection services component to the Justice Fund. Furthermore, the city manager will allocate funding to three organizations Long Beach Immigrant Rights Coalition, St Mary Medical Center and Central Park to serve as community connectors. The Community Community Connectors will be responsible for connecting community members to the Justice Fund, legal service provider to MTF, to provide outreach and education, to provide referrals to community services, and to serve as liaisons with clients and their families. These four organizations will work, collaborate, collaborate collaboratively. Use me to affect how we implement the justice plan going forward.

It's been moved and seconded to postpone this bill until June 14th and as sponsor of the motion, I will address it and then I will hand it off to Councilmember Herbold and then we'll open it up to the floor. Briefly, briefly. Yesterday in council briefing, we had a one hour presentation on Council Bill 120332 by our council central staff and lead negotiators in an open public session. Council Bill 120332 would authorize the mayor to implement a collective bargaining agreement between the City of Seattle and the Seattle Police Management Association, the SPM. The collective bargaining agreement is a four year agreement on wages, benefits, hours and other working conditions covering the period from January 1st, 2020 to December 31st, 2023. This proposed contract would supersede the former contract, which expired on December 31st, 2019. Let's see. So this contract is proposed. Contract affects approximately 80 regularly appointed city employees. Greg Doss, Counsel Central staff, outlined the key elements yesterday of the agreement in a memo provided to council members and made available to the public on Friday, June 3rd. So as Council President, I sponsored this legislation to ensure it's timely consideration in full council in due respect for the lengthy negotiation process. As I said this, the original contract expired in 2019. That being said, I would like to offer the opportunity for the chair of the Public Safety and Human Services Committee to make some comments regarding this legislation. Customer Herbold, thanks so much. Just a couple of words. I really appreciate the motion to hold and I tend to support it. Though Council did receive a very thorough briefing on the terms of the contract. We only received it 24 hours ago. I really appreciate the thoroughness of the negotiation process and the positive outcomes for our long sought accountability reforms. But I do believe that some additional time for all of us to familiarize, familiarize ourselves with the terms of the contract will be helpful. Thank you. If you remember, they could get some verbal.

But I want to wrap all that up today and really explain some of the differences between what we currently have and what we are proposing.

Speaker 10: Thank you, Tom. So I'd like to start the presentation by giving you an overview of the timeline that we've been involved in this effort. And it starts back in, in 2020 with the adoption, the City Council's adoption of the reconciliation report that called for this assessment, this independent assessment of the PCC. And as a result of that adoption, the City Council actually funded in the FSA 21 budget, this independent assessment. So staff then proceeded to go through an RFP process and we selected police change integration as the firm to actually conduct this study. And they have a we selected them because they have a depth of of experience in doing these kinds of studies nationwide. So their work took about ten months. During that ten months, they did extensive public outreach. As Tom mentioned, they did community listening sessions. They met did a presentation at the Public Safety Commission. They also actually went and presented before the charter amendment or I'm sorry, the PCC itself as a result of that in February of 2022, earlier this year, they did a very detailed report to this to the city council, pretty much outlining what they looked at in the study . They they surveyed the models that they were considering for the city's consideration, given the issues here in this community. And as a result of that presentation of the various models and their recommendations, City Council in February directed staff to go ahead and initiate that. The Charter amendment process. And those two initial steps in that process involved a starting the meeting confer process, which staff did and successfully completed the Phase one meeting confer. The second part of that process was to have the city attorney prepare draft language for the charter amendment. So those two steps were done in February. It was started in February and then in June, once the charter amendment process started this, the charter amendment body can conduct at two public hearings. And both of those",

The process begins with a nine member all volunteer customer review panel. They're appointed to act as the voice of the utility rate paying customer. During the planning and development stages of the Strategic Business Plan. The Customer Review Panel was appointed last September, met twice monthly with Seattle Public Utilities to work on a final recommendation, which they sent to the Council and mayor at the end of May, when the Seattle public utility started with that proposed combined rate increase that includes water, wastewater drainage and solid waste of an average of 6.8% increase in rates a year for for 2018 through 2023. Since then, they've worked, along with the committee to bring the possible rate increase estimates that they are that that we are proposing down to 5.4% in late May the well that was so that was the first round bringing it down to a consideration between 5.4 and 5.6. Then in late May, the utility sent out a postcard notifying customers of the planned rate hikes. Customers received that card in late June. The committee met three times since that card went out to discuss the the strategic business plan. During the final committee meeting, we considered and passed several amendments to bring the rate path down further, including assuming a more realistic SIP accomplish rate accomplishment rate, saving 1/10 of a percent, as well as requiring the institution of new system development charges to allow us to recoup 100% of the costs for new water taps.

In 2010, the U.S., the ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that tattooing is protected under the First Amendment. And then fast forward to March of 2017, where the city was involved in a lawsuit. And the court ruled, or at least had preliminary findings, that the existing zoning code unreasonably restricted the permitted locations of tattoo parlors in the city. And so therefore, in order to comply with the preliminary findings of the city attorney's office and city staff is proposing this update to the zoning code. Just to go through some existing regulations today, our zoning only permits new tattoo parlors with the with a conditional use permit in the following zones, just the H W zone and then also the downtown plan and the midtown specific plan areas. That's it for all the entire city. And so in addition to that, there are buffers, there's a separation requirement of 1000 feet from adult entertainment uses as well as tattoo parlors and bars. And there's also hours of operation regulations in terms of one of the reasons that the existing tattoo regulations seem to be pretty restrictive is that there there has been through time a sort of a negative stigma with regard to tattoo parlors. You know, and however that and basically today there are nine licensed tattoo parlors in the entire city of 50 square miles. Times have changed a bit.

He was ultimately shipped off to Australia as part of the, you know, the shipping of prisoners to Australia. He made a daring escape from the Australian penal colony on a New Bedford whaler ship came to the US. We've been talking a lot lately about how Boston is a city of immigrants and the country is a country of immigrants. And I think it really underscores that when O'Reilly showed up in the U.S. the day that he landed, he was naturalized as an American citizen. Something which doesn't happen these days. And he then moved to Boston and ended up becoming an incredibly celebrated and beloved man of letters here in the city. He was the editor of the pilot, which was this big Catholic publication, and he was also just a really well known poet throughout the country. And so when he died. Oh, and I should also say, really importantly, he ended up being a real cultural figure between the like the sort of Protestant establishment in Boston and the growing Catholic immigrant community who",

This task force was established through machine 15162 in June of 2018 in response to the Washington State Board of Health ruling allowing for a third option for designation on birth certificates to indicate a gender other than male or female. The six primary objectives of the task force are listed on page 17 of your packet and include reviewing the Board of Health ruling and determining changes that the county may need to make in response and consulting with county departments and community groups to assess county administrative processes, including but not limited to forms, questionnaires and interviews that include requests for information relating to gender identity and sexual orientation, and identifying administrative processes that could be modified to increase gender identity and sexual orientation inclusion. Table one on page 18 of your packet shows the current roster of Task Force membership with the organization stated in motion 15162 identified in bold. The group has been meeting in accordance with the initial framework adopted through motion 15603 and as is anticipated to complete their work in the middle of next year.

I don't know that there is necessarily a fundamental need to change the nature of our elections in Seattle with districts and democracy vouchers.

Speaker 4: In City Hall to discuss whether there should be measures that are advanced for the people of Seattle to decide whether the system of our elections is or is not appropriate and should. Speaker 0: Be changed. Speaker 4: The proponents of Initiative 134 have forced that question, and I commend them for it and commend them for their organizing. And I'm not going to use my platform today to disparage their proffered alternative approval voting. Beyond some comments I will make later about the limited adoption of approval voting. Speaker 0: But rather, I'm. Speaker 4: Bringing this proposal forward today to give voters the choice to choose the election reform that is more broadly adopted across the United States. The approval measure voting before us is conceptually new and sparsely adopted in the United States. Only Fargo, North Dakota and Saint Louis, Missouri used this system, and we would be by far the largest jurisdiction in the country to use this comparatively novel way of conducting elections. By contrast. Several know a couple of United States States, Maine and Alaska use ranked choice voting. And it's much more broadly adopted, as do the municipalities, bearing more similarity in size to Seattle, like Oakland, California, Oakland, California, New York and San Francisco, California.

So we only have access to view registration information. We don't have access to change any data. And that's something completely irresponsible from the county's end.

On November 5th of last year. This City Council adopted a Vision Zero policy aiming at reducing and ultimately eliminating severe and fatal injuries caused by traffic collisions in Alameda. This policy that we're bringing to you tonight, which was put together by our two departments working together, establishes safety as the number one priority for the design, reconfiguration and maintenance of city streets. Vision. Vision Zero dictates that we change the way the public right of way looks, feels, and operate. To achieve Alameda Transportation Safety and Climate Action Goals just for some of the viewers who might be listening in. This is a very important issue here in Alameda. This council taking a real leadership role in this, that the just one data point here between over the last ten years are on a ten year average between 2009 and 2018. Each year, an average of two people die and nine suffer severe injuries while traveling by either car by four foot on Alameda Streets. And just last fall, 12 collisions involving school aged children walking or biking occurred on our city streets. So we think this policy is an important step in transforming our network to be safe for all of our residents. It's not the final step.

Now Vice Mayor Andrew's recommendation to request city manager and city attorney to report back on the next steps and timeline for implementation of the Ethics Commission. Speaker 0: Come to Austin. Speaker 12: Thank you. So on November six, 2018, Long Beach voters approved Measure C with 61.9 or 61.79% of the vote as part of a series of charter amendments. Measure created the city's Charter and Ethics Commission for the purposes of monitoring, administering and implementing governmental ethics in the city. While the composition of the Commission and Appointment Procedure was contained in the Charter Amendment language, the Charter section entitled Staff Assistance and Budget reads Staffing for Administrative and management functions of the Commission will be addressed in the Municipal Code. The Commission will have a budget as determined by the City Council sufficient to conduct the Commission's mission and business. Therefore, Council, we must take action, further action through an ordinance and budget appropriation before the Ethics Commission can convene. And with this motion, we would request that the city manager and city attorney report back to the City Council within 60 days with possible steps that we need to take and propose timelines so that we may carry out the will of the voters in an expeditious manner as possible.

I want to extend my appreciation to cancer Louisiana for her willingness to lead on this issue with me. Despite her absence today through this year's budget process, we dug deeper into to get a better understanding not just of the figures and numbers from each individual department, but the Office of Budget Management's narrative analyzing trends in the city's fiscal condition over the span of several years. A couple of weeks ago, I filed orders related to city personnel and the state of the public sector workforce. After reviewing 20 years of staffing level data, revealing some striking trends, only looking at the current year and the past couple of years didn't show the historic trends. The same is the case for Boston's relationship with the state. We have to look at the long view to understand the big picture. Over the past 20 years, the city's net revenue in state aid has been reduced by over 300 million per year or a 70% reduction. Our state aid has been dropping, but but year over year, our state assessments for charter school tuition and the MTA climb exponentially. The result is in our budget, year after year is increased reliance on property taxes for a revenue source. 20 years ago, the property tax accounted for 55% of our revenue. Now, 20 years later, it's expected to reach 75% of our revenue. This relationship is unsustainable for the city and our residents. In 2006, Mayor Menino commissioned the BRT research department to conduct a report called Boston Gives More Than It Gets from the Rest of Massachusetts. It found that we generate more than our fair share of state instead jobs, state tax revenue, state income, corporate excise, and business tax revenue, visitor revenue, and state hotel tax revenue. But we do not get our fair share. It was a problem then, and it is a problem now. We have an opportunity to forge transformative partnerships with our colleagues at the state level. We have a mayor and city council whose policies at times require state approval that move at a glacial pace. We know our home rule petitions take forever. Like the CBA reforms reform bills submitted in 2019, which is still hasn't moved anywhere. If the state is going to pursue targeted scrutiny and oversight of the city of Boston, we should we should assess what is and isn't working from the current relationship for the interests of the city. Looking ahead, I believe we need a more proactive collaboration with this with the Boston delegation members, including those in leadership roles such as the leaders from my district and those chairing committees like Ways",

And this is a map amendment application is located at 2975 Huron Street in the five point statistical neighborhood in Council District nine on the western edge of the five Points neighborhood, just a half mile from Union Station in the CPV Prospect and neighborhood area, the request is to rezone the southern two thirds portion of the property, which is about an acre and a half to Cemex 12 to match the existing zoning on the northern third of the property. There's an existing five story multi-unit building that was constructed recently about in 2013. The applicant is not proposing to demolish the existing building or redevelop in connection with this requested rezoning. The objective, as stated in their application, is simply to unify the zoning on the property. So in terms of existing zoning and the portion of the property that is the subject of the rezoning is currently zoned r m you 30 with waivers and that's outlined in red. You can easily see here from this map that the existing split zoning is asking to rectify with a single existing multi-unit building spanning both the C-Max 12 and the RMU 30 zoning on that site. The waivers from 26 for that arm, you throw the old code zoning, those waived all open space and setbacks. You can see from this the surrounding zoning that there's a lot of CMCs 12 already in the area and AMI 30 is interspersed in there, but primarily it is Cmax 12. So a portion of the subject property is within the cause field view plane. The View Plane was enacted in 2009 to maintain and protect mountain views from the upper deck seats. Of course the view plane limits, building height, then a portion of that subject property. So that little bottom piece right there to a maximum of 73 feet in height. So that's about six storeys. In terms of existing land use. The property containing the subject site currently has a multi-unit residential building, as I previously mentioned. The properties in north is vacant land to the east. There's more multi-unit, residential and some office industrial uses and directly to the south as a restaurant and to the west is a multi-unit residential. So that gives you a flavor of what's going on in that area. The tap photos is of the existing building to which the southern portion of that existing building is the subject of this rezoning.

Sergio Romero is going to give us a quick presentation on it, along with John Keisler. Thank you, Pat. We're really excited about this project. As Pat mentioned, this is a project at a key intersection, a city in a, you know, key kind of gateway into the city at the north end of our city. Back in 2016, the city issued an RFP for the vacant piece of property. It's a former redevelopment agency property that was assembled back in 2010, and the property has sat vacant since that time. Through that RFP process, Frontier Development was actually selected for the property purchase and development of the property at a price of 2.1 million. At the time, the proposed property consisted of two retail buildings and a freestanding restaurant pad. Over the past two years, the developer has been working with city staff, the community, the council district to entitle this project to the credit of our planning department. Over that period of time, the project has now been redesigned. The project will consist is a very different product today than it was started two years ago. Heavy architectural improvements have been made to the project. The site is site design is completely different. It consists of heavy landscaping, nice hardscape finishes. The site design has been modified to increase a new building, so in total for new buildings in additional, the developer is now going to be undertaking significant offsite improvements that were not anticipated back in 2016, including new sidewalk and trees around the perimeter of the property, improvement of the alley behind the site, lighting a new bust off and on traffic improvements and undergrounding of utilities. The project will have significant benefits to the city. Speaker 12: We're anticipating about $90,000 in annual. Speaker 3: Property tax from this project once completed.

What we know is that Seattle is becoming a higher cost city and more and more people are struggling to afford to live in our city. Housing is obviously a big piece of that puzzle, and for most you households, housing is the largest cost, but transportation is a close second. And especially for households that are cost burden, the cost of getting around the city can often be the difference between having a viable life in the city or really struggling. The transportation equity program within the State Department of Transportation, sometimes in part designed to address the city's affordability crisis by providing access to affordable transportation options and thereby reducing transportation costs, especially for the most vulnerable and the lowest income communities. This resolution also asks that our side create a broader transportation equity agenda, outlining some of the principles and frames of the process for creating that agenda and identify some partners in the work. There's a team of folks at our staff that are working on this. Obviously, this is critical to have leadership from the department director, former director, who was a good leader on that.

Speaker 3: Good evening once more. This is another report. Excuse me. All of a sudden, my ear just went. Hmm. This is another report that was carried over from a previous meeting. Well, we report to you on a quarterly basis the sales tax revenues. Now. The. It is our fourth largest revenue source and it is important that there is attention given to the various elements and various impacts upon sales tax revenues. We should also be aware of the lag sales occurring in the one quarter are not our revenues received in the next quarter. So when we talk about this, we're talking if we're talking revenues there, they come later than the actual sales and we need to be aware of that as we talk about it. Most. There we have hired HDL companies to receive confidential data from the Franchise Tax Board and to provide HDL provides various analyzes to the city. These analyzes include the year over year change by major industry group historical trends over time by major industry group historical trend for the city as a whole. Historic trends by geographic areas and the geographic areas I just want to footnote were originally chosen by the City Council and we keep adding as we see new shopping areas, new areas developing. So we may want to revisit those at some point and decide if those are really things that we want to track. The surplus gap comparison. This really shows you how much sales tax dollars alameda alameda and spend in alameda versus what gets spent in other cities. It's referred to as the leakage report. It also has county wide comparisons, statewide comparisons and a general economic analysis of the nation, the state and our local east bay. This is a one of the analysis that we receive is called the 13 quarter trend. And it shows that over the 13 quarters since the most recent 13 quarters, we are trending up and that's good news. But it also tells us that when there is an economic downturn, this is a very sensitive and very volatile piece of revenue and we need to pay attention when that starts to happen. This. The next slide tells us about the per capita sales. This is the sales tax revenue per pop, per piece of population per person in the city of Alameda. And we still have the lowest sales tax revenue per capita as other major cities in our county. And we recently changed the county, the cities that we were looking at in order to be more comparative with those that we felt had similar population sizes as well as similar shopping, not just our neighbors geographically. So we are now looking at Oakland while they have. You know, bigger population. It",

Speaker 6: Report from Technology and Innovation Financial Management Recommendation to authorize the city manager to submit to the City Council purchase transactions for critical technology infrastructure needs citywide. Speaker 7: Mr.. Speaker 4: Mr.. Mayor. Council members, this, as the city Clerk pointed out, deals with critical infrastructure in the technology arena. We've already had a study session regarding this subject with the city council. It's been on the council's agenda a few weeks ago, but it was like 1130. Postponed till today. So here you go. Basically, we were looking at the history of financing in Long Beach and dealing with technology. In 2001, we were facing a $103 million deficit. It took 3 to 4 years to deal with that, but we stabilized the budget and dealt with that. In 2008, we faced the greatest recession since the Great Depression. That took a long time to recover from, but we did that as well. During the past decade or so. We focused a lot on streets, sidewalks, buildings and roads, but not so much on technology. During the past couple of years, we've conducted a major review of technology and infrastructure, technology, infrastructure throughout the city. This review is turning out that we have big needs to be the 21st century technology city that the community council commissioners all want us to be. We've discovered that we've had some critical technology needs that are imperative for us to deal with things like a new fiber network. Things like replacing outdated technology, replacing outdated equipment, security cameras, and dealing with the issues we're facing with those a brand new CRM system dealing with cybersecurity and electronic document management systems. So I also want to make it clear that we want to do this in a fiscally responsible way. For example, in our fiber buildout or replacing our outdated technology or even in transitioning into electronic documents, we want to know that. We want to make it clear that if the private sector can work with us for cost efficiencies, such as public private partnerships, will be open for innovation and working with our partners throughout the community to do that. So at this time, I'm going to turn it over to Brian Stokes, our director of technology and innovation. He's going to walk through the operations that I've just noticed here, and then I'm going to turn over to our finance director. John GROSS is going to talk about the funding. And the funding here is significant. It's a potentially $60 million of purchases throughout the next several years. This is something that won't be dealt with here in 2018, but certainly will be dealing with in 2019. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Brian. Speaker 10: Thank you. Good evening.

In the committee, we had 5 minutes of what's the right word, testimony, I guess, from both sides, and then made a recommendation. That recommendation was giving direction to staff on how to proceed.

It is a two part referral to create a straws on request ordinance and that other cities are at other cities. Not very many have started this, but when we do, our coastal cleanup and our plastic straws are really one of the things that we find that are like all over. And it's it's also you probably many of you probably seen the video of the damage they can do to our I'm going to say wildlife. But for instance, sea turtles, they get in the water. These straws also get in the water and can really damage our wildlife in the sea. And I also received I don't I don't know if this is in here, but quite a few classrooms from our local schools submitted handwritten letters in support of us doing this. And but what it really means is that we would be discouraging the use of plastic straws and and and that people would if they wanted to use a straw, they would have to ask for it and then they would, you know, receive straws that way if if the owner decided they wanted to have straws at all and you know how they wanted to do it. But, but they wouldn't it just automatically give you a plastic straw. And then the second part is other cities also looking at this, trying to move away from plastics as of plastic food, where there's just your forks, knives, the lids, the types of cups that are used to try to use more compostable and or recyclable materials. And again, it really primarily goes to trying to do our do our part as a city. And I would actually say be one of the cities leading the way on this effort to protect our environment long term. And I also want to thank Costa. They recently shared this movie, Time to Choose Many. And Alan Sean, he offered the theater out at the point for the viewing. And then we did also have many local vendors that offered food. And I actually forget the name of the company that did the food that volunteered that.

This is located in Council District five in the Montclair neighborhood. The applicant is requesting to rezone from urban edge single unit D X to Urban Edge Single Unit d1x to allow for an accessory dwelling unit. As stated previously, this property is zoned ESU d x, which allows the urban and suburban house forms on a minimum zone. Lot size of 6000 square feet. The site is currently occupied by a single unit home. There's mostly other single unit uses in this area with more commercial multi-unit directly west of the site. Then this slide shows the existing building form and scale with the subject property on the upper right hand side. A postcard notifying neighboring property owners within 200 feet of the site was sent out on September 21st. And then this went to planning board in early December, where they unanimously recommended approval. And to date, we have not received any any public comments regarding this rezoning. So the Denver zoning code has five review criteria that must be met in order for zoning",

I'll repeat this. This is a bill to provide legal representation to both tenants and landlords, small landlords and low income tenants. Why is it necessary? I come to you as a former tenant and our current landlord. The deals are simply better. The conversations are smoother. People feel more represented and they feel that they are being heard and have access to justice when they are represented by an attorney. 85% of landlords have an attorney. I believe less than 6% of tenants who come before the court trying to fight for their homes have an attorney . That doesn't make sense. I come to you also as a legal services attorney who understands that half the battle is oftentimes helping them navigate the system. Someone who gets an eviction notice, clams up, gets frightened, and may end up doing things that are not necessary, moving fast or signing documents they don't need to don't understand because they are trying their best to get rid of this situation. And what I encourage is for people to talk immediately to either go to mediation. But I can't imagine how frightening it is to show up in court. You don't have childcare.

The committee recommends a bill pass. Speaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Bagshaw. Speaker 5: And thank you very much. This is a parcel of property on Rainier Avenue South, and we're recommending that we acquire this. Seattle Public Utilities has been working on a lower Taylor Creek restoration project, and this will become part of it. And the goal is to improve the creek habitat and fish pass fish passage to replace a public culvert under Rainier Avenue South. And this will be akin to the work that was done up on Thornton Creek that will replace a small round tube with a larger rectangle through which fish can actually move. It also will help address localized flooding and reduce the sediment disposition that goes into Lake Washington, as in additionally to increase our public open space. So our goal is to be working with parks to assure continued public access along this line. The property was listed for sale two years ago. SPU negotiated a price of $545,000. And since SPU already owns a majority of the property for the project along this corridor, it will actually help lower maintenance costs and reduce the construction costs. And there is a house, an apartment building on that as part of the property right now. And SPU will maintain the property with its current tenants until about 2018 when restoration begins. So nobody's going to be evicted in the near future. And we are in the middle of a preliminary design and I would ask for your vote in support of this Council. Bill 118406. Speaker 0: Thank you.

We'll put that on the consent agenda for at the regular course. That takes us to our next item, which is about how the county can play a more active role in expanding and enhancing the market for compost that is produced using the organic materials generated by the county within the county. This report was required as part of the 2019 2020 budget. And again here Rose is here to brief the item as well as. Speaker 4: I am still here. Tomorrow's Council staff propose motion 2019 0353 What is the chair noted acknowledge receipt of the King County Organics Market Development Plan in response to a budget proviso. The materials for this item begin on page 335 of your packet, but I'm actually going to start on the following page on 336. So as I noted earlier in today's committee's meeting committee meeting, the Solid Waste Division is responsible for the disposal of waste generated in the 337 partner cities and the unincorporated area under the county solid waste system. Partner cities manage curbside collection of garbage, recycling and organics within their jurisdictions and in general contracts with private haulers to provide that service. While garbage is transported directly to the Cedar Cedar Hills Regional Landfill for disposal, recyclables and organics are taken directly to processing or compost facilities where materials are prepared for sale to manufacturers and other users. And I will just note that in order for mature materials to be effectively recycled, there must be a market for the end product. Approximately 1.03 million tons of organic materials were generated in King County, Snohomish County in Seattle in 2018. And this refers to things such as yard waste, food waste, wood waste, and 55% of that is attributable to King County, according to a consultant report requested by the Solid Waste Division. There are three composting facilities that accept and process organic material from residents and businesses in the region Cedar Grove, composting in Maple Valley and in Everett and Lenz Enterprises. So in the 2019 2020 Biennial budget, the council risk restricted $500,000 to be expended, only to develop a plan to expand and enhance the regional market for compost that's produced during using the county's organic stream. And to pilot the recommendations in the plan and also included in the budget is a linked proviso that withholds $250,000 until the executive transmits the plan to the council. And it also required Salt Waste Division in the development of the plan to consult with other county agencies and to consider best practices, procurement policies use in development and site rehabilitation projects and agricultural subsidies. Moving ahead to the analysis portion of the staff report on page 337. So in response to the budget proviso, the executive transmitted the proposed motion in front of the committee, which would acknowledge receipt",

The proviso requires the executive to include a set of recommendations, and these are divided into three areas in the plan . The plan notes that the division contracted with Cascadia Consulting Group for Market Assessment and Best Practices Research hosted two full day organic summits and consulted with county agencies .  Councilmember Lambert asked for the study to for capacity and uses and there's some great creative uses in here that are very pro-environment and environmentally friendly . But we also asked them to actually pilot some work by acquiring a product and putting that to use . The first recommendation noted there is to provide technical assistance to King County agencies to increase compost use .  To date, we haven't actually purchased piles of compost . King County government could and should be doing more to purchase compost . We don't currently have universal material specifications for compost .  Speaker 0: And we project that we will have that again. Speaker 3: We'll have that complete by the end of the biennium, consistent with the proviso. Speaker 5: So we're on a path.

I want to, first of all, thank Councilmember Andrews and Councilmember Supernova for signing onto this resolution to support the safe disposal of prescription drugs. This issue has been picking up momentum over the years. In 2014, President Obama announced new regulations that created a convenient legal avenues for safe, environmentally friendly disposal of unneeded prescription drugs. With the new regulations, neighborhood pharmacies and others were able to set up disposal locations. These regulations were in direct response to curb the opioid epidemic, which claims more lives in each year in America than motor vehicle crashes. Walgreens announced a few days ago that they are adding 900 drug disposal kiosks to their stores, and CVS plans to install 750 kiosks by June of this year. The opioid epidemic has a direct connection with homelessness in our community. My office receives phone calls and emails daily about issues and many of the individuals experiencing homelessness in Long Beach who are addicted to opioids. Drug disposal programs are one way to help stem the growing opioid crisis and reduce the number of drugs in our community.

Speaker 4: As background, Alameda Public Financing Authority issued a total of approximately 12.4 million and variable rate bonds. Speaker 1: Related to allow me to point in 2003, the source of repayment for these bonds as a rental income received from properties managed by the city's Base Reuse Department. Union Bank expired in. Speaker 4: The LLC, with Union. Speaker 1: Bank expire in June 14 of 2021. Fortunately, the city was able to receive an extension until November 15, 2021. With that extension, however, Union Bank increased the fee from 115 basis point to 125 basis points. Speaker 4: Plus they charge a one time fee of 5000 for the one time extension. Speaker 1: Union Bank has told us that they will not extend the LLC beyond the November 2021 expiration date. The market for the city's LLC is very limited because of the small size of the outstanding bonds. Typically, banks prefer large deals so they can. Speaker 4: Fine spread the cost of the. Speaker 1: Transaction over the size of the bonds. So the city reach out to other banks about providing a. Speaker 4: Letter of credit only. Speaker 1: To banks to express interest. Speaker 4: U.S. Bank in Wells Fargo. Speaker 1: Wells Fargo stepped. Speaker 4: Up and submitted a term sheet which offer a three year. Speaker 1: LLC at 100 basis points to the city. So is my.

I had a question about this lease arrangement and just wanted to understand what are the requirements of an organization who is maybe leasing space within a city owned building? What stipulates their participation in building wide safety protocols? Anything that has to do with with the entire facility. Lisa Lumley, Division of Real Estate. I apologize. I was actually trying to get some answers out in the hallway just now. So in general, all of our leases require that our tenants adhere to all applicable laws, state laws, city laws, municipal codes, etc. where I have a number of phone calls in right now, including to Chief Manny and Tony Caro. What we're trying to confirm is, is a fire drill a true requirement in every building other than, you know, it may be high rises, but since that's only a two level building, if it is a requirement, they would be required to participate any tenant. Your email today was the first that I was ever aware that there was an issue and I've already spoken with facilities about that as well since your email, just to understand what's been going on or who they've been communicating with. So all I can do right now is defer that we are trying to understand what is truly a requirement or a regulation. Code issue versus a building protocol. And from there, if it's protocol, we'd still want to work with them and talk to them about that to understand. But if it's anything else, then no, that is part of the lease. Okay. All right. Great.

So since I've been on council, I've been very clear that I'm not a fan of the Central 70 project. And this is a much longer discussion than I care to engage in this evening. But what I've been very clear on is my dissatisfaction with the fact that the Colorado Department of Transportation continues to fall short of adequately funding mitigation measures for the homeowners within 500 feet of the Central 70 project. This bill said it sets up a new agreement whereby the Senate offers up $2.3 million for mitigation for these 270 some homes, I believe it is. And the city of Denver is asked to put up, I believe it's about 1,000,003. Now, I'm going to choose to vote in favor of this, not because I've suddenly become enamored with this project, but because these mitigations are critical to preserving the health of the homeowners. I've asked the city attorney to help me to look at the original iwga and the annual allocations that will go along with that to see if there's any opportunity to recoup our money there. Whether or not I'm successful in that, I think these mitigations are important, and I continue to wonder why we can't get seed out to fully honor their obligation in this project. I'm aware that they're doing a lot in other areas, but this is one area where they're definitely meeting a shortfall. So thank you, Mr. President. Speaker 0: All right. Thank you, Councilman Casper and Councilwoman Ortega. Speaker 6: Thank you, Mr. President. This is a project that I've been very involved in from the very beginning, going back to when this was part of Council District nine that I represented. Councilman Cashman is absolutely right. These costs are costs that should be incurred by court. But the record of decision that was issued back in December basically only committed the $2.3 million that court is going to spend on the homes. And it's a minuscule number when you look at the overall cost of the I-70 project. But the fact that Denver is stepping up and helping augment what is needed for those homes and this really is still not enough. Some of us are still trying to find more money so that we can address HVAC systems for the homes. What Siedah is covering is all the windows and portable air conditioners, none of the doors.

Speaker 6: There are providers of ring that sell it for less than it is on the ring website with the $50 deduction. So if you buy it from ring, let's say I'm just going make up some numbers. It's $300. You get a $50 rebate, it's 250. But if you buy it at Costco, it's 250, let's say.

And the city and county of Denver was set forth in the 1967 Landmark Preservation Ordinance. Since then, the city has designated 351 individual landmarks and 56 historic districts scattered across the city, as you see indicated on the map. This equals roughly 7000 buildings or 4% of the city that are designated landmarks. The designation process is community driven and applications can be submitted by a variety of persons. For this property, the owner submitted the designation application. The owner is Rebecca Rodgers again. This is located in the South Park Hill neighborhood. This is Council District Number eight, Christopher Herndon. And the current zoning is U.S.. A property must meet the following criteria for historic designation. It needs to be more than 30 years old or of exceptional importance. It needs to meet at least three out of ten significance criteria, maintain integrity and be considered by the Landmark Preservation Commission for relation to historic context or theme run through each of these criteria with you this evening. The structure built in 1936 is more than 30 years old. It also makes three significant criteria that you see highlighted on the screen, made see to embody the distinctive physical characteristics of an architectural style or type, it needs to be a significant example of the work of a recognized architect or master builder, and it also represents to represent an established and familiar feature of a neighborhood, community or contemporary city due to its prominent location or physical characteristics. These criteria illustrate what makes a property a 6400 Montague Boulevard significant for historic designation, which is primarily its design excellence. And let's go through each of these criteria. More detail now. The Single Unit residence at 6400 View Boulevard embodies the distinctive, visible characteristics of the Spanish eclectic style. It possesses several identifying features, including an asymmetrical facade stucco cladding with decorative brick tile roof with multiple levels, elaborate chimney top arches above principal windows, arched front entry with decorative ironwork instances, balcony with UN railing and primary facade and second story covered",

Numerous high profile reports of harassment and abuse in fields such as entertainment, media, hospitality and government as well as through the MeToo social media campaign, have prompted many organizations to reexamine their policies and procedures to make sure that we promote a safe work environment. The victims of unlawful harassment feel comfortable coming forward and reporting. This is about ensuring that we are fostering here in the city of Long Beach a work environment and that we do not. A respectful work environment. And that we do not tolerate an abuse of power or a lack of respect or professionalism.

Thank you. Speaker 0: All. Speaker 3: Good evening, Mayor. And City Council members and the City of Long Beach has several policies regarding a EEO related to unlawful discrimination and harassment in the workplace. Those policies are posted online and they're also provided to city employees when they're onboarded as new employees. We also provide mandated sexual harassment training to our supervisors and managers. And also employees can file a complaint at five different places if they can file a complaint informally with their supervisors or managers, with the EEO counselor at their department, or directly with the H.R. department, EEO citywide counselor. They can also file complaints with outside agencies such as the State DFA or the federal EEOC. They can file those directly with those agencies. Employees can also file complaints or lodge a complaint with the city auditor. And if that happens, those complaints are then referred over to H.R. for investigation.

Speaker 0: Thank you. Councilman Ortega has been moved and second in a public hearing for council bill. Um, no one is open. May we have the staff report? Speaker 10: Good evening, Mr. President, members of city council. We are here tonight to talk about a proposed amendment to the existing Walton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan to add the 2460 Welton Street Redevelopment Project. The Walton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan was approved by City Council in September of 2012. In doing so, council found the Walton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan to be in conformance with the Denver Comprehensive Plan 2000 and its applicable supplements. While the Urban Redevelopment Plan authorizes the use of tax increment financing, TIFF cannot be used until it is specifically approved for a project. Therefore, the Denver Urban Renewal Authority is here this evening requesting City Council's consideration of an amendment to the well-known Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan plan to add the 2460 Walton Street Project and create the 2460 Welton Street property tax increment area. The Walton Corridor. Urban redevelopment area, as I mentioned, was established in 2012 to encourage redevelopment along the Welton Corridor. The urban redevelopment area is comprised of approximately 29 blocks, generally and approximately bounded by Broadway Street on the West Glenarm Place and 24th Avenue on the South Downing Street on the east and on the north by either California street or the alley between Welton and California streets. At the time, the Urban Redevelopment Plan was originally approved. No projects were identified. However, the plan allowed for future projects to request TIFF assistance and contemplated tax increment areas would be approved as projects were brought forward within the area. To date, one project has been approved. The Affordable Housing Development Project at 23 Welton. The project, being considered through an amendment to the Urban Redevelopment Plan this evening is the redevelopment of the site located at 2460 Welton Street. The project site is located at the southern corner of Welton Street and 25th Street. The project is comprised of three discrete buildings, built a above below grade structured parking. A five story stick on podium building at the corner of 25th and Welton will include 82 apartment units, 18 of which of which will be rent restricted to 80% of the area, median income or AMI and 3500 square feet of ground floor commercial space adjacent to the building facing Welton Street to the corner of 25th Avenue are nine townhomes, and additional five townhomes will be built facing the adjacent property to the southwest.

The 2460 Welton Street Project is located within the 29 BLOCK Welton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Area .

Comments by members of Council. Councilman Fox. Speaker 11: Thank you, Madam President. This is an ordinance that says the city will give business incentives to the Panasonic Enterprise Solution Company in the tune of over $1.3 million. Now, the good news is that it's great that Panasonic is bringing a an entire plant to the northern part of our city. And I'm very excited about that. I think it's very good, but I tend to disapprove of having money taken out of our general fund that taxpayers paid to fix their streets, to pick up their trash, to do the very basic services. Move it over to a fund that then we give money to mega corporations. I mean, we're talking about billions of dollars for Panasonic. And even this particular division of Panasonic is estimated to be earning 15 billion by two by 2020. And so it's not as if we really need to incentivize. They're doing jobs in order to reach that goal. They have to have employees. Right now, they have none here. So they have to have some employees to be able to build large screens that you can see in. Where you have our sport, like the sporting events, where you have the large display screens, that's one of the products they'll be making. They have to have the employees to do that. We don't have to pay them to do that. And so I look upon that as saying taxpayers did not pay money into the general fund to be used as a venture capital fund. I find I find that very inappropriate. And so I am usually the only one on council who feels that way. But I do believe that we do not need to engage in corporate welfare and I will not be voting for it. Speaker 3: Thank you.

Councilor Mosquito, you are the sponsor of this bill, so I'm going to hand it over to you to address this item. Speaker 3: Thank you very much. Council President. Colleagues, thank you for considering this legislation. This legislation is related to last year's passed legislation, ordinance 126161, which created the 2021 LTG Taxable Bond Fund and authorized an interim loan to support spending on the West Seattle Bridge in anticipation of the 2021 bond proceeds. This was before the 2021 adopted budget was presented and before the decision between whether or not to repair or replace the West Seattle Bridge. The 2021 adopted budget anticipated additional taxable bond sales for the Overlook Walk and Aquarium Expansion Progress projects, and directed those proceeds to the same fund. Now Finance and Administrative Services Department has since determined that we can sell non taxable bonds for the West Seattle Bridge repair, but that those bond proceeds will need to be held in a separate fund from the taxable bonds. This legislation does just that, this legislation accordingly. This legislation accordingly offers several technical corrections to the bond funds associated with the West Seattle Bridge repair work. And I hope the council will consider this message today. Thank you so much. Speaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember Mosqueda, are there any additional comments on the bill? Looking for hands.

We'll have a chance to hear from the governor shortly. Lastly, I'd like to thank all of our city staff and community members in attendance for this issue. Although it's customary for city staff not to speak on council items, I appreciate your being here in support. The use of the term genocide should never be used lightly, and our bringing this forward is not a suggestion of that. It's actually just the opposite. Its origin actually comes from Raphael Lemkin, who in 1944 used the Greek word Genoese race or tribe and the Latin side for killing. In describing the Nazi policies during the Jewish Holocaust, however, it's said that Mr. Lemkin also drew heavily upon his study of experiences of Armenians during the 19th century and early 20th century of the Ottoman Empire. The Armenian genocide is considered the first genocide of the 20th century and the prototype for future regimes intent on eliminating all traces of a particular people or culture. The denial of this atrocity and the willful ignorance of historical facts for the purpose of geopolitical diplomacy does not diminish what most history historians. Countless countries, cities and states know to be absolutely true. That the Armenians were systematically systemically subjected to deportation, expropriation, abduction, torture, massacre and starvation by the Ottoman Empire. And so tonight, I'm proud to recognize the importance of two thriving communities in our American culture, while acknowledging the willful genocide committed in their ancestral homelands. And many have espoused on this topic academically, politically, personally.

It was before the council back in October of 2015.

There are three major items that the Council wanted the Commission to look at further, and those are the items that I will address tonight. The other parts of the redlined ordinance I certainly can come back to if anyone has any further questions about that. Well, let me focus on the three major items and those items being the use of electronic devices at meetings. The amendments to the provisions concerning responsive responding to Public Records Act requests. And the third item having to do with the training. The Council will recall that we had recommended that the prohibition on the use of electronic devices be fairly broad so that they would not be able to be used at the meeting. Council had some concerns about whether or not that was unnecessary, if the prohibition was too broad. And so we sent the matter back to the commission for it to look at, and it came back with the language for that section that essentially reads very succinctly in order to ensure that all communications to policy board members presented in a public meeting are shared with the Public Policy Board members are prohibited from communicating electronically with others during public meetings that pertains to the business thereof.

And so we would recommend, based on the commission's recommendation of that, that that language be adopted, but with one slight change, and that would be after the word meetings that we add about matters. So the last part would read the policy board members are prohibited from communicating electronically with others during public meetings about matters that pertain to the business thereof. We think that will make the sentence read a little better, clarify it. And so",

There are no communications. We have one proclamation being read. Councilmember Cashman, will you please read Proclamation 20 1-1, two, six, seven. Speaker 2: Thank you, Madam President. This is Proclamation 21 1267 celebrating Denver after school programs in the 2021 annual National Lights on after School Day. Whereas the Denver City Council stands firmly committed to quality after school programs because they provide evidence based learning experiences that are proven to help youth develop social, emotional, physical and academic skills. And. Whereas, afterschool programs have continued to serve youth and families throughout the COVID 19 pandemic and play an important role in helping Denver youth overcome pandemic challenges of learning, loss, social disconnection and trauma. And. Whereas, afterschool programs are essential to Denver's economic recovery efforts because they are a vital support for working families who need to keep their children safe and engaged once the school day ends. And. Whereas, Afterschool programs prevent youth violence by creating safe, welcoming spaces for youth during the key hours of 3 to 6 p.m. where they can connect with trusted adults and cultivate the social emotional skills needed to make positive decisions for themselves. And. Whereas, The Denver Afterschool Alliance has provided significant leadership in the area of community involvement in education and well-being of our youth, grounded in the principle that quality afterschool programs are key to helping our children become successful adults. And. Whereas, many afterschool programs across the country, in our state and in our city are faced with funding challenges that are forcing them to close their doors to youth and families in need. And the temporary influx of federal COVID 19 relief funds will only provide short term assistance and not address the most industry systemic funding crisis. And where, as the city and county of Denver and the Denver City Council are invested in the health and safety of all young people by supporting expanded learning opportunities that will help close the achievement gap and prepare young people to complete to compete in the global economy. Where, as the Denver City Council pledges to support afterschool providers so that Denver's youth and families have access to programs that support their success and strengthen our city. Now, therefore let it be proclaimed by the Council and the city and county of Denver, Section one, that the Denver City Council recognized the recognizes the outstanding leadership of the Denver Afterschool Alliance in bringing together all stakeholders to create a collaborative, long term plan for our city's after school system and recognizes the 2021 national lights on after school day.

The rebuilding of phase one of the seawall started last December with demolition of the old concrete cap and sidewalk, installing 47 feet long steel sheet piles, redoing the drainage system, pouring new sidewalks and adding new lighting and benches. The canals provide a unique recreational opportunity that is special and a defining part of the Naples community and the city of Long Beach as a whole. People come from all over the region to kayak, stand up, paddle board or take a gondola ride through our charming canals. The Naples Improvement Association is gearing up for the 69th Annual Boat Parade on Saturday, December 12th.

Speaker 0: The chair recognizes counsel Braden. Counsel Braden. You have the full. Speaker 7: Thank you, Mr. President. Since the onset of the pandemic two years ago, it became clear how essential our city's community based, non-governmental, nonprofit organizations are. Many of these social sector organizations quickly adopted their direct services to meet the moment from a rapid dissemination of information, food and PPE and serving as mutual aid networks reaching thousands of our Boston neighbors. The nonprofit sector is also often known as the third sector because they fill gaps to reach underserved communities, often overlooked by private and public sector services. The past two years have shown the importance of local governments coordination with community based nonprofits to collectively need meet the needs of our residents. While many community nonprofits stepped up to serve our city, the entire nonprofit sector across the country has drastically taking a hit. With smaller, locally based organizations. Serving disadvantaged communities are often being most impacted. The country is experiencing what economists have dubbed the great resignation. Historic rates of workforce voluntarily leaving their jobs due to wage stagnation, rising costs of living and inflation and outdated workforce. Culture with smaller community based social services nonprofits being particularly impacted. The pandemic exacerbated many of the existing stressors with real estate speculation. Long standing nonprofits have struggled to remain in their office spaces. For example, the Brazilian Worker's Center in Allston is threatened because of increasing rents, among many others. I'm sure many of my colleagues can cite other examples. Meanwhile, support from from the philanthropic sector often limits foundation grants to specific programmatic work rather than general operating overhead costs, like rent and paying employees a living wage suitable for the city. In January, the Treasury Department issued the final rule, which outlined the specified eligibility uses eligible uses of ARPA funds to include charitable nonprofit organizations as both recipients of assistance, as well as providers of assistance to others on behalf of the city. That means our goals of achieving an equitable recovery must conduct and maximize impact through partnerships with nonprofits who have existing infrastructure as trusted messengers to hard hit communities. With federal funds, we have an opportunity to strengthen partnerships by supporting the incredible and incredibly important work infrastructure that is important infrastructure the community based nonprofit organizations in our city provide while also establishing infrastructure for long lasting, transformative government nonprofit partnerships that could be sustained beyond recovery dollars. This is an essential step toward equitable and sustainable relief, recovery and transformative future. And I look forward to holding a hearing to discuss envisioning that process for all for intentional investment in our city's nonprofit sector.

I move that resolution 16 dash 1317 be adopted. Speaker 1: It has been moved and seconded. Comments. Councilman Espinosa. Speaker 4: Yeah. The reasons why I'm calling this out for a vote is this. This resolution grants complete contracting latitude for up to $14 million for program. Managing that is TBD. To get this 14 million figure, the mayor's National Western Center office simply took 3% of the National Western Centers to see voter approved funds of 276 million. Well, it was stated that this number represents best practices. It is a very healthy amount for program management at this scale. Program management fees typically range from 1% to 5%. The higher percentages are typically found on relatively inexpensive projects. Once you enter the millions and tens of millions of dollars, program management fees move closer and closer to 1%, which tends to be a significantly large dollar amount. Well, I have faith that the NWC can and will capture the entirety of the NWC program management needs for the funds that will likely be allocated tonight. The millions of dollars in latitude that this generous contract provides makes me uncomfortable. By voting for this resolution, Council will choose to distance themselves and therefore the people of Denver out of a project that our voters supported based on certain outcomes. Once the contract is approved, the program management work that will be scoped will not require a vote by council. That distance is neither necessary or warranted.

And we must be equally committed to fostering inclusive, nondiscriminatory workplace respect of all of our employees. And and we've been recognized by this municipal equality index, recognized city of Long Beach as one of the best cities for LGBTQ inclusion through law and local policy, following the local policies by our educational institutions Cal State, Long Beach and Long Beach City College. Both of those institutions have included have began the process of implementing preferred name policies. A preferred name is a first name that may be used instead of a legal first name. The city of Long Beach currently distributes city ID badges and email domains based on one's legal name. So if an employee were to transition names that would be required to undergo a court order process for their for their place of employment to respectfully change that individual's name. This process can be rather extensive. And in the interim, I think it's important that we create an internal policy that is both sensitive and responsive to the needs of our transitioning and gender non-conforming employees. As staff examines what this policy might look like for Long Beach ID badges, internal external directories, name plates, email, email domains, staff signatures indicative of one's preferential pronouns should be considered. So I am. I'm also encouraging city staff to work with the center in Long Beach to make sure that this is a policy that is thoughtful, thoughtfully prepared.

Speaker 0: And this is the staff's report. Speaker 1: Good evening, Madam Mayor, Honorable Vice Mayor and members of City Council. My name is Aaron Smith from the Public Works Department. Tonight is a public hearing for a proposed sewer service charge increase of 3% annually for the next five years. I'd like to start with a little bit of history before getting into the specifics of tonight's hearing. Back in February of this year, Council adopted a resolution stating city's intent to revise the sewer service charge based on a report conducted by Bartle and Wells Associates. That rate study is an exhibit to the agenda item tonight. Please note that since February the report has been updated based on council feedback. The figure for which compares sewer service charges across the East Bay collection system agencies was updated to now more appropriately compare the proposed Alameda rates to the current city of Piedmont rate for parcel sized 5000 square feet or less. Otherwise, no other changes have been made to the report since February. Speaker 0: Thank you. Speaker 1: The sewer rate study was tasked with evaluating the sewer program's funding needs and revenue sources in light of the federal consent decree that we will operate under for the next 22 years. Based on the evaluation, the report recommends a drawing down the sewer fund reserves, which are currently higher than recommended levels and a phasing in of a 3% annual increase over over the next five years. This approach allows the city to maintain the recommended reserve levels, meet expenditure needs and avoid any steep rate increases for the duration of the consent decree. Procedures for amending the sewer service charged are contained in specific provisions of the California Constitution, more commonly spoke of as Proposition 218. So following Council's resolution in February, city staff mailed out a notice to property owners informing them of the proposed rate increase tonight's public hearing and protest procedures. That notice is also an exhibit to your agenda item this evening. 9 million protests have been received by the city clerk in advance of the hearing tonight. No written protests have been received this evening. State law requires council to hear and consider all public comments received this evening, but that only written protests are considered in determining a majority protest. Without a majority protest, a majority vote by council tonight can approve the proposed rate increases. The staff report before you tonight contains a typographical errors, saying that a 4/5 vote by council is required. That's not the case. Following tonight's. Speaker 4: Speakers visit. Speaker 1: Simple majority. A simple majority. Thank you. Yes.

The beauty was adopted in 1997 and applies to whole parcel as shown on the map. It was intended to allow for the construction of a single building with 66 units for a special care home for senior citizens. It allows a maximum height for a building of up to 35 feet. The facility was supposed to be an extension of the ministry of our Standard Lutheran Church, but financing was not secured and the special care home was never developed. The duty also allows for the development of uses allowed in R-1 district, which is a predominantly single unit district in former Chapter 59. The existing land use on the site is vacant. It's surrounded by mostly public possible uses where the church is to a north west single unit, residential uses to the north, northeast and east, and commercial retail uses doing so while the subject site is currently vacant.

Recommendation to award a contract to Waste Management for recyclable collection services in an annual amount not to exceed 3.5 million citywide. Speaker 0: Okay. Mr. West. Speaker 7: Mayor, council members. Over the past few weeks, there's been a huge amount of misinformation provided about the procurement process with regards to the recycling RFP, which we have attempted to correct. Each of the four firms have a financial benefit from securing this contract, so it is natural that they will be doing everything possible to secure the award for their company. This is a very common practice in California and throughout the nation. Recycling and trash procurement is one of the most competitive procurement processes any city can undertake. In large part due to the length of the contract period and the large costs of providing the service. Recognizing early on that the procurement process for recyclable collection services would be a high profile, sensitive one. City staff hired H, F and H, an independent consulting firm, highly regarded industry expert in refuse collection and recycling procurement. Their role was to lead us through this process from creation of the scope of work of the RFP to the evaluation of the proposals. An RFP procurement process was selected to find the best value for the city, which includes a number of criteria affecting the service, including implementation, cost, revenue to the city, potential disruption of services and service reputation. H.f. and H is an expert in compiling various proposals and comparing apples to apples. As in many cases, firms will have varying benefits or costs in their proposal. They are highly respected for their expertize transparency and independent analysis. HFA and H has served over 300 public agencies and managed over 70 competitive procurements. In fact, each of the four firms we considered has each used the H, F and H forms and bidding process in the past, and each has won under that process. In summary, city staff has taken all the necessary steps to conduct a transparent procurement process by hiring a chef and H. A highly regarded and reputable independent consulting firm. However, since questions have been raised and with the memorandum from the city auditor stating that she has concerns based on the issues discussed at the March 8th meeting, I feel the best approach at this point is to reject all proposals, rebid the contract and request new proposals. We need to ensure the issues raised are properly reviewed and addressed. If they prove to be factual. To respond to that request to the request of the auditor. I will be engaging in an independent. I will be engaging an independent financial firm to review the concerns and have input from both the city auditor and city attorney. The city auditor and the city attorney will have the ability for complete input into this review, and the result will be a report",

We can advance to the next slide. Speaker 4: I don't know. Speaker 0: Thank you so much. There we go. So the city does manage 25 different city owned parking assets and that includes seven parking garages. The Aquarium City plays Broadway, Lincoln and 100 Broadway, which is our garden lot behind us. We also have nine different beach lots. So what are we seeking in a parking operator? We're really looking at someone who can provide maintenance for all of our facilities, who can provide customer service, and who can really look to ensure that all of our patrons are safe using our garages. Some of the maintenance work includes sweeping trash removal, regular power washing of the facilities and then minor things paint, touch up, graffiti removal, things like that. To give you an idea of the scale of what we're talking about in fiscal year 17, we anticipate that parking operations will collect almost $9.4 million gross revenue. And our largest structure is the aquarium structure. It receives almost 745,000 visitors annually and generates almost half that revenue, $4.4 million. So quite a big operation. I think. Not only does it support the aquarium, but certainly many of the restaurants and businesses down in the Pike area. We're also interested in supporting our special events. As we all know, Long Beach is a great location for special events. We see our special events growing from year to year. We have some major events in the Grand Prix, our Pride Festival, Long Beach Marathon and most recently we've seen more and more activity occur down on the Queen Mary with the concept of Queen Mary Island. This year's Queen Mary Dark Harbor was so popular that there was special transportation arranged between the aquarium garage where many of the patrons would park to and from the Queen Mary as part of that event. Also need to recognize that we have a lot of filming that happens in our city.

So a quick refresher on case a Long Beach, CA would replace the incumbent electric utility, in our case, Southern California Edison, as the default buyer of electricity for all Long Beach residents and businesses. The idea was that a CA might procure lower priced and cleaner power. Then see. Yet, Edison would continue the transmission of power over its existing poles and wires. The Long Beach CA concept has been discussed in various aspects several times with the City Council and the Sustainability Commission. We have completed our due diligence. Staff has continually urged caution on the forming of a ceasefire. Council directed staff to conduct four tests as shown on the screen. Number one Monitor Sica's relative to current and emerging markets and related regulations. Number two, evolve the partnership between the city and city to promote awareness of existing and emerging programs focused on increased energy efficiency and greater utilization of renewable energy sources. Number three, facilitate community outreach regarding the CCAR concept along with potential risks and benefits to customers. And number four, undertake a study that analyzes CCAR governance options. Green Power Alliance S.p.a. Is the primary school in Southern California Edison's service territory the largest in California? CPA has presented to both the City Council and the Sustainability Commission in the recent past. Orange County Power Authority, a newly launched DCA in FCC territory, will not begin service to residents until late next year and therefore cannot be used as a benchmark.

Recommendation to support Resource Recovery Coalition of California's Emergency Solid Waste Funding proposal, which provides additional support to Alameda County Industries in response to financial impacts of the pandemic. So ACR had reached out to, I think, individual members, at least myself and I'm sure others, because this got on the agenda to have us send a letter to the state to include, you know, recyclers and waste haulers as part of any recovery efforts. And, you know, I think this is a good thing for us to do. And again, I just wanted the opportunity, you know, if if the council agreed to have all of us sign on, if we also agreed so. Speaker 0: And one of the things that they talked about, and I think sent me a letter to was that, you know, we have a time where because of the shelter in place ordinance, many businesses are closed and those that are operating are operating at reduced capacity. They've had a number of client businesses simply cancel their accounts. And the way we have public works director Liam Garland here. I see.

This agenda item actually was initiated by you, Mr. Mayor, during your comments at the state of the city. So I want to thank you for initiating this item in this conversation and getting it started. And as you said, at the state of the city and as I wholeheartedly agree, a city cannot thrive and be a place where people visit and live and offer exposure to the youth without a strong arts programing, without strong commitment to the arts, and without a wide variety of options in terms of different types of arts that people can enjoy and participate in in the community. So the purpose of this item is really to get the conversation started and to ask our city staff, led by our city manager, to look at all the different models that are adopted around the nation to support arts programing in various cities. And my intent with this particular item is to really focus not on a particular organization or a particular type of art, but really talk about how we can bring about more support for the arts in their totality. Visual arts, theater, arts, music, everything that we would put under the umbrella of arts, we as a city should be supporting, regardless of the organization or the entity or the the person that's pushing it. We really should be focused on how we provide arts programing and arts opportunities for our residents and our communities. So this is obviously something that is very important to me and my council colleagues. On a personal note, my family and I partake in just about every arts opportunity that we have, the opportunity and the and the time to participate in our kids. It's there growing up with arts in their life and they are very lucky to live in a city like Long Beach that has so many great programs already and so much potential for additional growth and outreach in terms of the great work that we already do and that we have the potential to do. So I hope that my colleagues will support this particular item, which really just asks us to be educated further and gives us some options on how we can go about getting funding for the arts.

We brought on board the services of a nationwide consultant. So with that, I'm going to turn this over to Jason MacDonald, our purchasing manager, as well as Craig Beck, our interim public works director, to walk us through the RFP and recommendation. And thank you very much. Speaker 2: Thank you, Mr. Manager. Mayor, members of the city council. We have a quick PowerPoint to walk you through the presentation tonight. So basically, why do we have recycling here in Long Beach? Besides it being a good thing, we actually have a requirement under the California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 to do recycling that the city needs to do waste reduction, offer recycling in an environmental safe disposal manner. We started our recycling program here in Long Beach in 1993. We've been providing that since that time. Additionally, in 2012, AB 341 added mandatory recycling for commercial properties. The city provides generally recycling service to multifamily units that are ten units or less, and those that are larger will typically go to a private hauler. So currently the city contracts with the Waste Management, who services approximately 118,000 active accounts with curbside pickup. This contract ends at the end of June 630, 2016. And so we're before you here tonight to talk about a new contract for recycling services. Last year in 2015, roughly 27,000 tons of residential waste was collected. Residential recycling, excuse me.

And our staff analysis is based on the rezoning and not any specific development project. They're requesting to rezone to the C three zone district in the Denver zoning code. The C stands for our urban center neighborhood context AMC's indicates that it's a mixed use zoned district and the three indicates the maximum height allowed in the district. In terms of number of stories, the property is sandwiched between two neighborhood contexts. To the east is the urban center see neighborhood context as their requesting and to the west is urban neighborhood U. Zone districts to the east are more intense. Mixed use districts to the West are less intense residential zone districts. And then all along Colfax are Main Street mixed use commercial zone districts. The current zoning is a plan.

As the city manager said, we are here tonight to talk about a very critically important issue. We did discuss this briefly a year and a half ago or a year ago when we adopted the housing element. And the housing element is a very powerful tool in that it is really setting for us the road forward for the next several years until 2021. On the programs and policies that we're going to be focusing on to ensure adequate housing opportunities and adequate housing resources to all sectors of the community. The housing element has a number of programs that we implement on a on an almost regular basis with really not a lot of fanfare. Part of those programs are just part of the daily operations of the city we are part of. And part of that is something that we want to talk to you tonight. It's about code enforcement in particular. When we were adopting the housing element, there were a number of concerns that were raised by stakeholders about the habitability of our housing stock. And frankly, our housing stock is aging. We are an older city. A lot of our housing stock is, frankly, over 30 years old. We have homes that range from single family homes to 20 units and more. We have large complexes. We have multifamily complexes that are high rises. We have multifamily complexes that are four story buildings. It really runs the gamut across the city. And because of that, we did hear the stakeholders concerns about habitability and how we were addressing habitability, both under state law, which does require inspections for multi-family housing and then for for our specific program. And so what I want to talk to you about tonight is the program that we're proposing to you tonight, which would increase the type of inspections that we are doing above and beyond what's already allowed under state law.

This was like a New Year's resolution that I'm I'm I'm having a lot of help making come to you before the end of the year. It was a yearlong effort to review all our ongoing reporting requirements and code. So everywhere in the county code that says to somebody that they must report to us to determine which ones are useful and should continue, which ones can be combined or changed in frequency, and which ones are no longer useful and can be eliminated. We briefed the committee on this project in September. We have had a tremendous amount of staff work on this and so I just really want right up front say thank you for that because we're getting to the point where we can now start to update the code, but there are quite a few little technical ins and outs that need to happen in a multiplicity as code update of this sort. So Tara Rose from staff is here to present the staff report. Aaron Osnes is also here. Don't you go ahead and take it away. Speaker 6: Excellent.

Speaker 6: So then I'll begin on page 12 of your packet and start with some background on the project, just a little refresh. So at the direction of the chair this year, council staff are engaged in a research project reviewing the King County Code to identify required reports to council and focusing on those that are at a regular ongoing frequency. Proviso responses and reporting requirements to other entities such as the Executive were not included in this effort. And as the Chair noted, the committee received a briefing on this project in September. Staff found 119 of these ongoing reporting requirements to council and also identified the enacting legislation for each requirement. And some of these date as far back as the 1970s, reporting requirements generated by state law or in a local agreement are not included in this number. Council analytical staff and other legislative branch staff were consulted about whether these reports generated by code requirements were used in their",

Speaker 10: Honorable Mayor and members of the City Council, thank you very much. We're very excited to present this item in partnership between our two departments. What we've got here is a piece of property located at 1400 West Wardlow Street. This is on the West Side. You'll recognize this is just below the 405. In just a little bit east of Santa Fe, it is approximately 60,000 square feet. So it's a it's a big piece of property. It's a it's a sort of triangular shape. And in 2001, the city of Long Beach entered into a lease with the Tanaka family to turn this space into a recreational space for the West Side residents. So currently since 2004, we've had this collaboration between the seventh District Council office and the surrounding community, various departments, including Economic Development and Parks, Rec and Marine and the Tanaka family, to provide access to about 5800 residents in the half mile radius of the property. And the way that we describe this is primarily as a passive park. So we don't have, you know, sports leagues and and other permitted uses. But it does have a really great playground, half court basketball on some benches and a perimeter walking trail. And that perimeter walking trail is a great asset, particularly for our West Side livability plan and neighborhood use. And so what we're looking at is essentially that the Tanaka family had indicated that they were going to sell the property they were going to listed, and the purchase price listed was approximately $1 million. And of course, with the due diligence, which is some environmental review and administrative costs associated with escrow or closing costs, the total purchase price that we negotiated with the Tanaka family is 1.1 million and $5,000.

Good evening, Mayor, vice mayor and City Council. In 2020, the Federal Consolidated Appropriation Act authorized the Emergency Rental Assistance Program, known as ERAP, followed by the state's SB 91, which established the state's program for administering its share of funds. The state offered to run a rental assistance program on behalf of the city, which was called Option A, or to provide funding to the city for it to run the program itself. That was option B and the city of Long Beach chose option B. The city received $30.2 million in combined federal and state grants referred to as ERA one, ERA one. And in March 2021, the American Rescue Plan established an expansion of Erap, which is referred to as ERA two and was administered similar to ERA one. With that program, the city received $34.3 million and ERA two funds. In total, $64.5 million in the city is expected to fully obligate these funds by the end of June 2022. The Federal Government. The Treasury has allowed us to apply for funds that were clawed back from agencies that did not do as well as we have done with our program. And those are called recapture funds. So we're working on that. But in the meantime, the State Senate Bill 115 established the State Rental Assistance Cash Loan Program, providing short term cash flow loans for eligible option B jurisdictions participating in the ERAP program. Option B's and cities, including Long Beach, will be able to receive cash flow loan payments in monthly installments. The amount of the state loan program will be determined by the amount indicated",
